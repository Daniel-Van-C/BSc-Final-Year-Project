"Every time I hear this song now I think of Johnny Cash. Man who lived a full life. There was sin and there was sorrow. There was happiness and joy. He experienced moments that we can possibly imagine..... And then the last month of his life and his wife's life they chose to record the song and make this video. I know they had to have known they were nearing the end. Not just for themselves but there's a couple because that's the kind of love they had. I like to think that they did it to let everyone know no matter how much you feel like you have screwed up,  no matter how much you feel like you owe a debt, and no matter how much you feel like a sinner... There is a place for all of us and whatever comes after.'I don't particularly give a damn who you believe comes in the here after but there's a place for it all of us. Some of us just have more lessons to learn than others. But that doesn't make our lives any less beautiful. In fact maybe it makes it more beautiful because we have to work for it. This man, his wife and so many more of us have to work harder for it. But we are all worthy.","2022-04-19

was first introduced to Johnny cash via wyclef jean's album 'ecleftic' but only heard his name and his influence on 2 or 3 records on the album. watched a documentary about Rick Rubin and heard his name being mentioned again. today I was going through a course and then his picture pops up on a Spotify image used as a class example and I saw HURT with the most streams. So I decided to come to YouTube and boy am I blown away. This is entirely different from anything I have ever heard. sounds like it was made during the time of Beethoven.

He introduced ne to johny cash and this song was with out his best. He leaves himself completly open and raw. Beautiful to hear in his voice and lyrics you feel touched by all he reveals. You hear johny and who he is, his life and what it meant to him and how precious life is, to all of us. Arent we all there? Feeling it all everyday until the end.","2022-04-01

"I know all about this song, the ins and out from start to finish. It really makes me feel like an expert when anyone mentions it because I, if I may call myself an expert. The facts about the writing and the musical notes I can list off from memory. People are always amazed with my musical knowledge but my secret is and why I can call myself an expert is THIS is the only song I know everything about, I can list each writer, sound guy, and musician. I'll never forget the first time this song played over the radio, time and the earth stood still, it's lodged in my memory like a splinter. I probably think about that moment more often then I should haha. I think it was the moment my sense of self started to form. Hence my obsession with this particular track, and whata track it is. Anyways if anyone has any questions as to the creative process behind this masterpiece just ask I'm always more than happy to talk about my favorite song.","2022-04-01
