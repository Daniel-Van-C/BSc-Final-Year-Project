NIN official video got only 1% or less the total views this got. Johnny Cash was great. But to ignore the original this much is a shame.,"2022-04-27

"It's so poetic, no words capture what's going on here. This, I think, has turned into the biggest song in his whole career, I'm not sure. But just imagine it... Even Trent Reznor agreed. He made this song his own. And Trent, probably one of the first of the rockers to mainstream singing about emotions this way.... And Johnny Cash 'out-emoted' him. 😳","2022-04-26

"'I pop the video in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning – different, but every bit as pure.''        Trent Reznor","2022-04-26
