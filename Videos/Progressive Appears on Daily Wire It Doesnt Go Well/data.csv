What an L for pakman. Knowles was kind and have you the floor and you get dismissive. Petty,2022-04-26T03:53:40Z
This is simple IMO…'1. A Supreme Court justice is supposed to be apolitical ' unbiased. '2. Asking whether or the Supreme Court nominee can define a women shows whether or not she has a political bias. '3. She refused to answer ' that says EVERYTHING,2022-04-25T17:45:59Z

"I have to wonder if David Pakman has a learning disability and is just not capable of challenging conversation, or is just dishonest.

Knoles never said that, he did give a list of several ways the answer could have been given. At 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOSlwtyA_M't=7m20s"">7:20' packman is either that dishonest or as many times before he can't seem to process information in conversations to any real productive extent.

"You did an amazing job shutting down the attempt of grandstanding.  The trumpublicans have no actual policy.  They will never really say any policy other than freedom, low taxes, and guns.. They have changed a lot since the 2000's Bush era Republican party where at least you can debate them.  Now it just seems like children throwing tantrums and trying to talk about the opponent not the policy.  It all reminds me of the movies Gladiator, when they say the way to keep the mob happy is give them blood.  They know this and make a show of everything. Thanks again.  Keep up the good work.

"LOL ' i don't do dictionary defintions', words convey meaning. In order to confirm we are refering to the same meaning and move forward in a conversation, we all abide by the definitions of the words in the english language. The purpose would be to avoid utter chaos where no one can decide which idea is better than the other idea. Have you ever tried to talk to someone about a math problem where one person thinks the word 'five' equals 2 and 'six' equals 3 when deciding how many slices of pizza a customer wants? 'Welcome to pizza pizza, How can I help you?' 'I would like five slices please!' 'Thanks for your business! Here's 2 slices! Have a nice day!' '....wait, i ordered five slices'.

"As much as I dislike Michael's take on things, it is pretty basic to understand that the definition of woman has legal relevance. That fact that you ignored that reflects badly on you. In order to have a good faith discussion on your part, you have to acknowledge that certain definitions actually do have legal ramifications, and this happens to be a relevant one at the moment. You have to be able to recognize the question, and admit it is an issue that needs addressing, regardless of what your opinion on it is.",2022-04-13T00:17:56Z
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼,2022-04-12T23:53:30Z
I love that Jackson refused to define 'woman' and specifically said that she wasn't a biologist. That means she must adhere to a biologist's standard definition while she is on the court. She cannot state that she has the knowledge to make that decision without relying on experts who would provide a scientific definition from which she must decide any rulings on cases that come before the court.,2022-04-12T17:24:06Z
Mr Pakman thank you so much for making a spectacle of yourself on the daily wire. very entertaining! Hahaha I thoroughly enjoyed it.,2022-04-12T17:08:54Z
Does a dr go by weight and gender? I mean if a 250 pound man and a 250 pound woman have the same disease do they give you the same medicine based off of weight or muscle mass? Men have more muscle mass. I’ve never seen a 250 pound woman that was straight muscle but I have seen men 250 pounds straight muscle.,2022-04-12T14:26:05Z
"Good grief. So, suddenly the left, progressives, whatever, have decided that they're going to upend everything that has been true since beginning of human history, because it furthers their loony agenda.

I’m always intrigued by how the tone of the conversation is presented on the front end.  To try and position oneself as smarter and the other as dishonest or ignorant is not likely going to lead to a humble discussion around different points of views.,2022-04-11T15:54:04Z
You are a joke! Definitions have never mattered in the courts? That is a lie! Leftists want all definitions to disappear. Mike gave specific points as to WHY a legal/philosophical definition matters in this case and this bozo two danced and emotion ed around providing a response. I want to watch him tap dance stour her pro pedo history!,2022-04-11T14:39:10Z
Disappointed with Knowles to be honest.   He tried so hard to be polite that he ended coming across like a person star struck. He shld have roasted you.,2022-04-11T13:59:47Z
Was this an argument between basic reason and smugness? Michael has a valid point and I did rewind the tape and Michael never said what David claimed he did. David seems like he smells his own farts....,2022-04-11T12:09:05Z

Legal definitions absolutely matter. If there were no legal definition of man or woman than there couldn’t be any laws tailored to them. There is a discernible difference between the two that for all of human history people were comfortable answering. If a man wants to transition to feel like a woman he has every right to. But in the eyes of the law he must be treated as a man.,2022-04-11T05:26:32Z
People like Pakman are the worst. They act and argue like absolute children. Always rude and smug when talking to those who have other viewpoints. And yet Michael is so respectful and stoic.

When they run out of logic they just resort to insults and disrespect.,2022-04-11T05:20:44Z

The whole point of that movement includes them! Trans women are women, and so are cis women.. its not exclusionary, no one is being attacked, you can keep your personal values, like its really not a big deal or very interesting and yet somehow its the hill to die on for the con's...

Progressives hate women nothing more. This is the ultimate form of misogyny. Allowing men to cosplay as women. Making mockery of women.  Any woman that can just go along with this foolery that anything can be a woman dispite the biological difference you are part of the problem. Progressive policies will eventually undermine the same feminist that so called fought for these rights. Facts don't care about feelings sorry not sorry. A man can't be a woman and a woman can't be a man. You have gender disphoria you need help. Mutilating your bodies trying to indoctrinate children in your weird fantasies to get approval and validation of your existence. It's disgusting and down right evil. The same women who want to protect women's sports women's spaces are the same ones allowing it to get destroyed. You refuse to acknowledge facts over emotions.

Fantastic work David as these guys audiences need challenged and this is the technique all over the world from the culture war right. Arguing over the definitions applied when the judge applies the law it is not her definition of that law that is applied. That is for sentencing but this argument over transgenderism is the one the right like to use as it ropes in older people (The same question was asked of Keir starmer in the UK for a similar purpose) and then they can spout the rest of the nonsense,2022-04-07T08:10:23Z

It's a biologist's job to define what a woman is, not someone who practices law. She was right to give the response she did. What Michael is missing here is that if there was a case brought to the Supreme Court that involved defining a 'woman' (Title III, Title VII, Title IX, or whatever), then more than likely an expert's opinion will be sought.

"I'm a fan of Pakman rather than Knowles, but this was a flop performance on Pakman's part. Knowles was being completely respectful. There's nothing wrong with defining a word for the sake of a discussion. Oftentimes words have multiple meanings or have meanings that have been misconstrued by culture that have completely lost their true meaning. Think of the word socialism for example. Socialism no longer means what it technically means to the average person. When the average (U.S.) person hears or reads the word socialism, they're more likely to think of the country's who have implemented socialism, like the USSR and Venzuela, and how it's a generally bad thing that results in a dictatorship. What socialism truly means is an economic system in which the means of production is socialized. It's important that we define words that have ambigious meanings because often times many words have multiple meanings to different people, and if we dont set out a clear defintion pf the term, any discussion regarding that term will be futile. What Knowles did was not bad faith at all.",2022-04-06T15:46:48Z

"I don't understand how, even from his own argument, he can hold the stance that the definition of a woman has no bearing on her job. That definition can in certain cases be instrumental for the outcome of the case, and there are cases that are likely to become more and more frequent in the coming years. Another thing I don't understand more generally is the insistence on definitions of words being unnecessary. A word not necessitated be a definition means nothing at all, so why even have the word. If the word ‘woman’ means nothing, then why say ‘trans woman’. If ‘woman’ means nothing, then the word is completely superfluous because you’re given no more information by the presence of the word than its absence. You can argue about the definition, but not the necessity of a definition, for in the absence of a definition you lose the ability to communicate altogether",2022-04-06T12:02:35Z

To ask for a definition of a woman with no qualifiers on whether you are referencing legal definitions, biological definitions, or cultural definitions at a confirmation for a JUDICIAL nominee means the default for the nominee should in fact be a legal definition which Blackburn would have attacked from the other two standpoints. It was solely meant as a dog whistle gotcha moment to make her say she believed trans women were women and then beat her over the head with it, which is to make a cultural argument that she couldn't address legal issues which would have been a non sequitur.

"Pathetically embarrassing. As much as i enjoy Pakman, he’s merely evasive for 10 minutes, and not on an especially fascile way. The definition of woman is irrelevant to her position, but Pakman, offered the opportunity to provide a working definition, using as an expansive linguistic palate as he could imagine, could do nothing. If you don’t have words, you can’t think. Obfuscation is sophistry.",2022-04-03T19:44:34Z

This is the all over the place non sense the left spews and they don't even know it.

That was what Ketanji Jackson added she said I'm not a biologist.

Liberals hate defining words because their strategy in a debate is to convolute issues to the point where experience and rationale are thrown out in favour of individual feelings. This strategy places enormous political capital in 'personal truths' rather than objective reality which is obviously a horrible strategy when creating public policy.,2022-04-03T18:12:31Z

You totally wanted to avoid the topic of defining what a woman is. As soon as he brought up the legal definition of a woman you wanted to leave that discussion immediately. You so badly wanted him to trip over his words when discussing this and it shows your dishonesty very clearly. Then you straight up dodged the question yourself by trying to define what a dictionary actually is? That was the most cowardly thing I’ve ever seen you do.,2022-04-03T18:02:00Z
"Wow what an embarrassing video for Pakman. I honestly thought he was better than this but he came off totally amateurish.

It’s also not fair to criticize her as unqualified for her response to this question. The reality is, she does have to dance through political hoops, I’m sure.''On the other hand, Pakman’s condescending attitude made the communication falter, as he put words into Knowles’ mouth and wasn’t willing to actually hear what he was saying.

The question around what is a 'woman' is ment to expose if she cared more about activism then being an objective legal professional. Is that line of questioning trying to back her into a corner? Of course it is but It's also perfectly reasonable to not want overly emotional activist judges running the show.''Also the lefts response to the hearing was full of bad faith reactions, plenty of high-profile people called the senators racist and that's about as bad faith as you get. The hearing isn't ment to be easy, she was supposed to get grilled, part of the process is just to try and get her to react. Bad faith is not excepting that treatment for this person but being perfectly happy with all the crap Amy Barrett got in regards to her confirmation.",2022-04-02T22:22:58Z

If you don’t “do dictionaries” you ought to go climb into a hole.",2022-04-02T16:09:28Z
David seemed way too cautious of Michael Knowles attempting a “gotcha” which is understandable since he’s been on Jesse’s show. He doesn’t realize Michael Knowles is an honest guy who doesn’t deal in that. I think that’s where everything went south. Hopefully he can go on Michael’s show again or vice versa and they can have a better discussion in the future.,2022-04-02T15:59:57Z
"For someone to identify as something there first has to be a point of reference? Genders are constructed by society based on their roles and their roles were through history and evolution predetermined by their sexes. To say that sex and genders are not the same is one thing, but to claim that there's no correlation and that genders are solely socially constructed and that everyone who feels like it should be able to name their own and then that they should conform language and other people to it is nonsense. I get that they're making the whole fuss because some people are insensitive and denying that there's any such thing social construct and gender spectrum. But I don't see how it's a issue picking one of two genders/pronouns in traditional sense. It's more convenient, works for wast majority, and if you feel different and that you don't really fit into those simplified confinements you can tell it to people around you. It's a good system in place for differentiating between nice folk and assholes. If you guys in US weren't so self-centered and opted for learning few other languages you'd realize that stuff like 'they/them' don't really work in many cases.  I'm not from the states, and in our language there isn't even a word for 'female/male sex'. Word 'female' is literally translated as 'womanly', derived from the word 'woman'. You made a non-issue into an issue, and politicians, corporations and media are sparking this debate to distract people from more important things. GOP made it into it's core issue in present America . The fact that it is being used for speech control and political distraction and disunion of working class people is a real issue though.",2022-04-02T15:26:29Z
"If we can’t define what a woman is, why was it so important for the President to nominate one to the Supreme Court? And furthermore, how do we know we successfully did it?

Of course, definitions are important. When it comes times for KBJ to write decisions and rule on important cases before her, surely the words she writes or articulates will have specific definitions. If words have no objective meaning and are instead subjective for each of us how can one ever reach consensus on anything or even know what subject is being talked about?",2022-04-02T15:07:13Z

"As an example of why pinning down a specific definition is difficult/foolish/pointless:''Consider two hypothetical court cases. In the first, someone is fired and alleges that they were terminated on grounds of sexism and misogyny. So whether or not they were a woman would be extremely relevant in that case, and would revolve around social cues, like how they look, acted, and behaved, and the case would turn on how the employer acted based on those things. Even if you believe yourself to be a man and that you look, act and behave like a stereotypical man, if your boss nonetheless believes that you are a woman and fires you solely on that basis, then they are in violation of anti-discrimination statutes and will likely lose their case.''An alternative: there is a pharmaceutical diagnostics company that makes a sophisticated test to detect diseases. Some diseases appear more frequently in one gender or another, a gender being defined as a specific grouping of biochemical markers and traits. A patient is misdiagnosed by this test, is given a treatment that they didn't need, which caused side effects of which they died. It is alleged that the company negligently designed or administered their test and that it assumed the wrong gender when interpreting the results.'Gender would again be a lynchpin issue in the case, but it would have a VERY different meaning and context.",2022-04-02T12:33:53Z

"From my understanding the only legal definitions in the justice system are for the procedural functionality of that said system (writ, tort, statute, subpoena, party, hearsay, docket, etc). Any other terms (eg 'women') that relate to written laws (eg title IX) are either defined in those pieces of legislation or undefined, which is when the art of litigation takes place to debate the interpretation, intent, and application of stated law(s) for a particular case scenario. So to answer the broad question, what is a woman? You need both context and a scenario. What is a woman in relation to the survival of the human race and our reproductive ability? What is a woman in relation it's significance of being in love with another person? What is a woman in relation a school's fulfillment of Title IX? The short form question is too simple to adequately answer because 'woman' has many definitions that are dependent on a particular scenario. It does make for a useful political tool because it seems like it should be easy ? to answer but in the context of law and one's qualifications to be a judge, it's is a very poorly worded question (if your intent is to actually discuss the topic vs generate political responses)",2022-03-31T18:42:13Z

"It's extremely important for the left to always reframe issues with conservatives and focus solely on policy proposals. They have their supporters convinced that they're on their side by being pro-pickup truck, anti-abortion, and 'anti-woke'. My mother is a conservative and she was aghast when I told her about Rick Scott's policy proposal to raise taxes on half the country and sunset medicare. Their supporters aren't even aware of where the politicians stand on the issues, because the RNC is somewhat intelligent enough to know that they'd lose support if they were more upfront.''The left is far too reactionary - meaning that when the right engages in discussion to say 'Ha! You don't even know what a woman is. Vote for us!', the left engages in these nonsense cultural grievance discussions. We should 100% of the time goat the right into discussing healthcare, the minimum wage, childcare, etc. Stop playing on their terms. Instead, go onto their own platforms and force their audience to see the truth, that the conservative movement is actively trying to make the average conservative voter's life worse, and they hide behind a veneer of 'Americana'.",2022-03-31T14:50:57Z

It could have been a rhetorical trap, but words and definitions matter. Seems David is playing a rhetorical game here himself by stressing that dictionary definitions are fluid in that they're only descriptive. Yes David, they way we describe and define things matters in many aspects of life.''Also, I know David Pakman is one of the lefts favorite figures, but he comes off very condescending and dishonest when he starts making subliminal digs at the host of a show he was invited to.

Women have the most rights at this point in time than they have almost ever had....and the left pretends that they are freeing women by tearing them apart and extinguishing them. It's immoral.

"If you can't agree on the definitions of words or at least stipulate which definition you will be using in the course of a discussion, then all discourse falls apart.  I think this is at the root of all argumentation.  To refuse to agree on a definition of a term or concept simply allows one or both sides to move the goal post.  To say that he only discusses politics and won't agree to stipulate the definitions of the terms he's using is a bad faith move.  If womanhood is the issue being discussed, as with transgendered folks in women's sports, then a definition of what a woman is becomes crucial. I ask myself, which side of an issue benefits from keeping a cloud over a term or concept, and that's the side you need to pin down on clarity the most. The down side of politics being everywhere in the media is that everyone, including most commenting, think they should play politics.  There was a time when defining what being a 'citizen' meant was quite relevant to a lot of people in this country. I'm glad we pinned down a definition of that, or else I probably wouldn't be able to voice opinions at all, in this country.",2022-03-30T22:39:41Z

Frankly, I think that Pakman went out of his way to quibble about phrasing because he didn't want to actually engage with Knowles' (salient and important) point, which is that when one is the arbitrator in an issue where boundaries are being delineated, one has to be able to distinguish between the categories in question. 2) David interrupted Knowles as much, if not more, often than Knowles interrupted him (I counted). 3) Going into a conversation expecting the person you're speaking to will be acting in bad faith is actually a form of bad faith on your part; David was the one implying negative things here. 4) I hate how David's demeanor comes off as if he thinks he's the one whose side is most ethical. '''I teach at a public, division 1 university. I have two swimmers who've missed class for the past two weeks because they lost to Lia Thomas and now need counseling. I have an aunt who was an Olympic swimmer, who roundly disagrees with the idea that one should be able to compete against whom they choose; in fact, an enormous portion of sports is an act of defining precisely who one CAN'T compete with because it undermines what sports are founded on: fair competition. ''Defending a tiny minority at the expense of the majority--in a situation where it really is a zero sum game; where what's best for one group is worse for another--is unethical. I cannot understand how someone who's progressive can expect that a judge will do her best to fight sexism--to even the playing field and provide protection for rights which don't apply to men--while also being unable to express or define the differences between those categories.''Though Justice Brown's maneuvering was strategic, I don't understand how David doesn't seem to grasp the legitimacy of where Knowles is coming from.",2022-03-30T20:34:44Z

"The truth is, this was a decent back and forth. I agree with David that this is not the most productive thing to debate or ask in a confirmation hearing.

"You missed in this one. It was easy. Just challenge him to do the same thing and then take it apart. 'Woman' means different things in different contexts. Is there a hard cut off for when a girl becomes a woman? Is it legal for intercourse, legal for marriage, able to vote, menarche, 'deflowered', some feminist idea of emancipation, having a Bat Mitzvah?'' And 'the' dictionary definition? The fact that there are more than one dictionary, each containing more than one entry gives the lie to that. The debate of prescriptive/descriptive only exists in the public mind. Prescriptive went out with the Victorians and Confucius. Language does not have a spec (see the use of 'preferred' in the Chicago Manual).''And there are more than one type of dictionary-- popular, medical, biological, anthropological. If you mean the colloquial definition, you'd better go look up the squishiness of the word Colloquial. As well as Dialect, Ethnicity, and I don't know, maybe Wittgenstein.''When does a word become an 'official' word with a final fixed meaning? When the OED inducts it? Is there a ceremony? (actually there is for French, but you wouldn't want to be like the French would you?) OMG!  Things change. We learn stuff, we 'advance'. That is explicitly what the Right exists to deny and impede. Everything was better before and things are eternal. Comforting but stupid.''Until recently, homosexuality was a medical condition. It was no more a proclivity than 'people of cancer'.''What is going to happen: We're going to make up some new words. Just like we need ones for bio-mother, birth-mother, care-mother(s), and legal-mother(s). Add: 'legally adjudicated father (deadbeat-daddy), man who has acknowledged paternity (whiteknight-daddy), husband of biological mother at time of conception (cockhold-daddy) or birth (legalsystemunclearontheconcept-daddy), man listed on birth certificate (romcom-daddy), un-rebutted presumed father (jesus-daddy)'. In the same way we're going to have: bio-gender (what you've got in yer genes), expressed-gender (what you've got in yer jeans), phenotypic-gender (what you had before you wore jeans), identified-gender (what brand you've got on yer jeans), legal-gender (what the geniuses should get rid of). There isn't even a word for female human is there? ''The Right wants to dream of some definitive Platonic source (kind of handed down by God along with objective morality), that they can use to complain about kids being fast and loose with these days. ''Make the analogy to the abortion debate. The Right does not like continuums, they like bright lines. We make cutoffs for expedience when we have to, but we should not then go back and claim that that captured the heart of the matter. ''Ok fine, all of that is lovely philosophy which would make the best and brightest of the Rightosohere glaze over. So go all medical-evil on his ass.'''There is intersex.' It is a thing whether you want it or not. We have been trying to pretend this away for centuries. 'Sex assigned at birth'? At least do 'they' get to decide when they reach majority? ''There are hermaphrodites, and not just in Japanese comic books. Do they get to use either bathroom? If you bang them are you gay? If they father a child and also give birth to one they are on different certificates as a father and mother, right? No sex change needed. If they decide to cut off half their bits in order to conform to social norms 'then' they are a tranny? What was the gender that they trannied from?''There are conjoined twins. Sometimes they share a genital. But the heads express differently. The age-old question-- who is in charge, the big head or the little one?''There is XXY. There is XYY. There is XXYY and XXXY. There are 'mosaics.' Do the chromosomes get to vote each other off the island?''Zygotes are people. Pretty soon we'll be able to swap out an X for a Y. Better protect the other snowflakes by keeping the pervert on a separate petri dish.''Corporations are people. People must have a gender. Are they assigned one at incorporation or is it in their DNA?''If there was some value in nailing all this down then more power to ya.

"I don’t get it. Seems like David Pakman got wrecked in this debate. We all know what was being asked. Should trans woman be consider the same legally as biological woman, and the same for trans men and biological men. This is a legitimate debate and worth having and cases will come to the Supreme Court that are relevant to trans issues. There needs to be a discussion on this. The problem is progressives like Pakman and Jackson don’t want to have this discussion, and they play dumb. They want to have it both ways: keep liberals popular among normies, and avoid getting cancelled by the trans radical activists. This is a relevant thing to talk about. I’m not a right winger.",2022-03-30T04:58:03Z

"The brief answer to what is a women is that “That’s a fascinating question that we are all now dealing with given the recently recognized legitimacy of transgenderism.” In the same way that What is a human being? would have been answered differently by most white people 200 years ago compared to today. Or the term “marriage” is defined differently now by most rational, thoughtful people than it was just a few years ago. The Right has gradually revealed its dark side, which is the idea that any form of deceit and manipulation is allowed to get what they want. Michael is just a congenial and clever purveyor of the same toxic ideas. I support calling out the lies whether told by liberals or conservatives. But there is no longer even an attempt by Republicans by and large to hold their own accountable. We can thank Trump for pulling back the curtain and revealing the contempt most Republicans have for honesty, integrity and civility.",2022-03-30T04:29:46Z
"The part that is “not in good faith” is that most of the uses of gender being argued are actually situations of sex not gender. We have historically used the words interchangeably, but we now all understand that is wrong. However, instead of using the correct word sex the left clings on to gender because they know that is less rigid in its definition. We don’t divide sports by gender but by sex. That’s why whenever women and men compete it is called the battle of the sexes (not genders). Spanish isn’t a gendered language but a language split by sex. Spanish words are male (masculine) or female (feminine). Gender encompasses much more than biology, but most instances where gender is being debated/applied, we mean sex. Until we all acknowledge this, we can’t have an honest discussion.",2022-03-30T04:18:27Z

All I heard was a confirmation that she has issues identifying a woman but can clearly state stances on other things are soft ball questions. I get the political side of playing to the best of your ability however I just want clean straight answers from someone regardless of your political stance left or right because that goes much much farther into understanding how you will handle incredibly important decisions for our country. People will get up in arms about it no matter what side of the aisle but that doesn't matter. As long as you're not attempting to hide your true intentions it's cool.,2022-03-30T03:54:06Z

"I’m a huge language and linguistics nerd. In all seriousness, how can we use words (let alone properly) if we can’t even define them? How can we express ourselves or communicate, if we don’t know what words mean or symbolize, nor what words to use to describe something? How can we structure or use language if we don’t know what the hell we are talking about or referencing? It’s baffling that people do not comprehend this slippery slope of language degradation. Don’t even get me started on spelling and grammar, which seem to be non-existent... another worrisome thing for language. ''If we can’t define what a woman is or what the word “woman” means, what else can’t we define? How far will this go? Will we just remove all definitions from all words, or only the ones we don’t like? What is grass? What are colors? What is a vehicle? Do you see how silly this becomes? You can’t have a language if the words have no meaning. Shall we go back to cave man grunts, squeaks, scoffs, and sighs? ''I don’t align with any political party worldwide and I don’t trust governments. Politicians and things such as voting, are illusions put there to make you think you have a say and/or are a part of something. Politics divide people.

"I'd say rhetorically this was a decent showing, but there really wasn't much of substance from either side in this debate. Was kinda boring and passive-aggressive, nothing that was productive.''David Pakman should've defined what a woman is at the end. A part of showing progressives have a better grounded ideology is being able to trace a political stance back to the ethical system and root from which it came. At least Michael Knowles actually did it by saying: 'Words are supposed to mean something' in other words he says there's a 'fact of the matter' for the term woman. David Pakman refused to engage when chances are he would've held the position 'Definitions are created by humans and should be changed if they create greater utility' thus the definition of a woman should change if it produces greater utility for our society. Had David done that, it would've been a very fun and interesting conversation.",2022-03-29T23:39:46Z

"The idea that a judge should be opining about what gender is so fucking stupid. Judges on some level prescribe social categories through interpreting legislation (laws often reify social categories), but that is a side effect of answering the question a specific law may raise. Jackson was right to not answer that as that's a question to be handled by experts in culture (sociologist + anthropologist not like pundits lol) in amicus curiae briefs. But we all know how much conservatives don't want people who actually study culture to define a woman. And the medical institution intentionally has nothing to say on the subject as they focus on the female body and not culture (well this wasn't always true but medicine has changed significantly since the 1920s). ''Imagine reading a supreme court majority opinion that says 'if you don't have a vagina tough cookies you can't be a woman'.

"I generally appreciate David Pakman, but on this topic he is either dishonest or ignorant.''Altering the definitions of words is common politics. The right has tried to re-define “liberal” with the term “classical liberal”, to imply Liberals are authoritarian. The left tried to re-define “racism” to imply racism could not come from minority groups. These are political activities designed to alter our society. In fact, the core battle of two massively important political movements, feminism and LGBT+,  is over the definition and concept of the word woman. To imply a discussion on definitions is irrelevant to a political or a legal conversation is gaslighting. To imply it is bad faith is to weakly dismiss the concerns of the right. After all, the right is merely responding to the political efforts of the left to alter the society through definitions of the word woman. As the supreme court has exercised society altering powers by literally interpreting words to mean certain things, it is absurd to claim questions on definitions of words at the center of political discourse are off limits. I want to understand Pakman’s point and I want to see dialogue on this topic, but he was so dismissive to the rights concerns that there was no chance the conversation would go anywhere.",2022-03-29T16:26:27Z

"Words and their meanings are old and come from the limited observation of past groups of people.  Sometimes they are vague, and sometimes they can be extremely specific. The problem arises when societies and it´s views on categories change, as well as when, with the growth of the population, more and more different statistical events start to become more apparent, one of them being infertility/not producing eggs (the specialized cells). So now it´s no longer that a woman is someone who has eggs and can have a baby (in the case of someone with Turner´s not only are they more likely than not to be infertile, but they don´t even have that many of the secondary sexual characteristics associated to women. Many a times will have small breats, not having that much of a curvy body, etc). Plus, not always is a woman interested in having kids. But beyond that, when science becomes a thing and it also progresses and discovers new things, it also becomes a force that leads to changes in society. In this case, it is no longer valid to say that men are (exclusively) XY and women XX (although it is the main sex differentiation system for mammals. other animals from different groups work differently, some not even having sexual chromosomes). It was discovered that the man/male part only arises if a specific gene, which is present (most of the time) in the XY chromosome, the SRY gene, is there and is functioning. So now, we don´t exactly know what is a man nor a woman just by using a single or few things to back it up. Then we have genetic alterations, affecting the number of chromosomes (duplicating or deleting whole ones or stitching together broken parts of other chromosomes into a single one, resulting in having an extra...), which can also affect sexual cormosomes (XXX, XXY, XYY, X0, etc), leading to 'men who are women' and 'women who are men', and I´m not even talking about transexual and intersex/hermaphrodite people here (there´s also the hormonal and physiological aspect of it, not just the chromosomes)... So human sex has always been a messy thing, but it just wasn´t perceived like this before (although, different societies many times also had something akin to a third sex, or something else entirely...). I´d say that human (chromosomal) sex (de facto, taking into account all these things i´ve mentioned) is more like islands. There are different kinds, and some may looks just like others. It´s (to me) not a spectrum, because you can´t directly change your (human) sexual chromosomes at a will nor through other methods, but it´s also not something binary, black and white, set in stone. And if you really want to see something crazy, I recommend you search up (genetic) chimerism/chimeras and mosaicism in humans (and other animals if you feel like it)... So yeah, not easy, but something in the law is gonna have to change, and/or the definition of a word will have to.",2022-03-29T14:59:07Z

'socially constructed factors associated with the female sex.' you could add in 'traditionally' and 'socially constructed means it's subjective' or whatever.''pretty damn good. while of course we can all recognize the bad faith of the right in asking these questions, i think it would do A FUCKTON for progressives and leftists to have a definition to just slap on the table. because as it is, 'leftists don't even know what a woman is lol' seems kinda true, because everyone is afraid that some twitter user will come along and say 'but i'm a woman and i don't think this definition is true'.",2022-03-29T14:43:53Z

Her answer could give insight into how should would rule in cases that have to do with transgender men or women or non-binary persons.  The argument of cases don't come down to dictionary definitions is a ridiculous argument given the context of the cases that are coming or will come on this issue.  If KBJ accepts the medically and psychologically backed concepts of being intersex or transgender, then it means that she may rule a certain way.

Why won't he give his definition of woman? He says he doesn't deal with definitions? Bullshit. He, like everyone else, uses definitions all the time. Will u define wealth disparities? I bet you would. He doesn't want to define woman because on one hand he would make the lgbtq...lmnop...crowd mad. Then on the other hand, perhaps he doesn't want to give the 'gender is only a social construct' definition because he knows that's bullshit too.  And if u want say you are this or that, that is fine.

Someone who exhibits femininity''So if we go off this Webster Dictionary definition of Woman, which is an adult female, and then go off Webster's definitions of Female:''A. Would a woman born without ovaries not count as a woman because they can't have children or produce eggs? What about a woman in their 80s - is she not a woman anymore?

He shouldn't just be able to claim that he identifies as a woman and get off on charges of being a creep.''So maybe in the future, you are going to have to REQUIRE being legally recognized as either a man or woman (starting with the biological sex at birth) and if you decide later on that that biological definition is not appropriate, you will have to appeal to a governing body to have that legal status changed at some point.''Seems like this would be the easiest way (though not the least legislative way) to define your gender status.''That would certainly not make a lot of people happy (to have to ask permission to change gender from birth) but it would certainly clean up the legal definition.",2022-03-28T15:08:34Z

Whether or not she said that at the time, I think that would be a very relevant point to bring out to Mr. Knowles - considering that that very question could be part of a case that she may preside over, it would be unprofessional of her to pre-decide or define that before hearing evidence/reasoning from both sides regarding it.",2022-03-28T03:41:32Z

"I think it would have been best to interview and debate BTC. This was a waste of time. It would've been more challenging to interview Jon Stewart, as he would have you think about your thinking and processes. It would be more enlightening. David was correct in the sense that the Court Hearing is merely political and wasn't a question done  in good faith. The pattern in the line of questioning were just culture war issues. There's multiple definitions for what is a man. Biologically, it is a male with a penis, Adams apple, and ergonomically masculine with a more endured physique. Culturally: they are the bread winners, man of the house emotionally negated, hunters, family builders and leaders, hard labor workers, uses logic more than emotion. ''However, not many of a particular enclave of people would approve of either definition. More accurately Republicans and some independents would and it would be seen as something that makes sense. Though it isn't inclusive and it is alienating to those who feel invisible. It would also wreck their mental health to never be able to be accepted and there's legal filings that sets precedent which would contradict what republicans and some independents thinks. ''The problem with this line of questioning is that it is arbitrary. What's Jackson's qualifications? What's her integrity? Is she willing and able to separate her religious or personal views and rule objectively regardless of the political biases. Even John Cornyn's statement was made in bad faith and basically called bush a war criminal while but trying to say it as if SHE did. It would've been true but we're looking for accuracy.",2022-03-28T01:36:48Z

"Wow ... David, when you said, 'you're either dishonest or ignorant,' that pretty well nailed it.  To me, I would say that this host is uneducated.  Saying that a woman is someone who isn't a man is simplistic to the point of being childish.  And I bring this up because I've been running into Conservatives who are like the host you're speaking with.  ''When they want a definition of a woman as someone who isn't a man, in most cases, they're speaking of biology.  But gender isn't biological.  Gender is a choice; biology isn't.  And 'man/woman/boy/girl' are social cues ... they're labels.  And labels are subjective in this sense.  I agree, Judge Brown Jackson was wise not to fall for this.  It was a trap.  (When a baby is born, if it's not a male is it a woman?)''Now, if I were in this spot Judge Brown Jackson was in during this 'hearing' (more like interrogation) it's doubtful I would have been able to keep my mouth shut.  I admire Judge Brown Jackson not only for her intelligence and wisdom but also for her patience, dignity, and grace under pressure.  And to me, this says more about what qualifies her for the Supreme Court than any sort of dictionary definition Conservatives were looking for.  ''This type of black/white/right/wrong/good/bad thinking is the hallmark of Conservative thinking.  In a way, I sort of envy this.  The world must be a very simple place for them.",2022-03-28T01:17:22Z

"I don't think you've played this as I think it should have been. The question isn't really the definition of a woman, but whether trans women should receive the same protections as cis women do. Presumably it also concerns trans men, but the right doesn't want to remind people that they exist as well. Anyway, I think you should have asked why do they need to define it, and either explain how you see it, or point them towards someone who's willing to. I think trans rights are going to be an important talking point for the right, with all the usual fear mongering and finger pointing, and trying not to talk about it may not be the best strategy.''My view is that trans issues point to wider gender and sex issues and injustices in our society today. All the fear mongering about men wearing dresses and invading the ladies' bathroom points to important topics around female safety. Trans women in sports are a proxy for many drug and hormone use issues in professional sports. There are ways to spin it, and there are ways to talk about it, including saying 'I don't know', with each one of them being, in my view, better than avoiding the topic entirely.",2022-03-27T22:33:31Z

In the interview, Knowles admits that answering the question puts her into a bind.  For her to answer the question, would be falling into a trap. So why then is he 'upset' that KBJ never answered the question. ''There are lots of problems with Knowles definition of woman. His answer was the ability to produce a child. Problem: People born with just a X chromosome cannot bear children, therefore are not a woman. He also mentioned there are laws specifically designed to protect woman. That's incorrect. There are laws designed to protect against discrimination based on sex.

The assertion that there is no definition of woman or that it's fluid  is just dishonest. If they are writing laws surrounding it, then they have a definition in mind when they write the law. If citizens are expected to abide by those laws, or are capable of challenging them, then the citizens need to know what you meant by what you wrote!",2022-03-27T14:45:22Z

When I was a child, almost 60 years ago (my mum had strange limits due to her illness), my mother explained to me that some children had both sexual organs, some a mixture, that she had babysat such children. Society defines those children, often surgically, as one or the other (or used to), but that's simply not the case. I assume the answer they wanted was, 'A woman has two X chromosomes', but as noted this is a simplification not born out by reality.

There's also the definition of having two X chromosomes, but one out of about 600 men are born with two X chromosomes. It's called Klinefelter's syndrome and 3/4 of men who have it have no idea.

There is a reason she was asked to define woman. If they asked her to define man and later were asked to do it themselves thry would have found themselves up shit creek without a paddle immediatly.'Remember that conservatives and rightwing extremists deny that including women in a text and/or them being explicitly mentioned with 'men includes women here. We do not have to say it includes women. Men covers women too'. So men is at the same time the opposite of women and includes women.'The same argument is used in highly gendered languages like german where Kaufmann is supposedly okay as a job title for men and women (notice the mann=man) and Kauffrau is not needed... but of course they do insist that Mann and Frau aren't the same at all.,2022-03-26T23:43:55Z
"I think Michael would have been ever further  flummoxed  if you had time to introduce some basic biology to him let alone the masterful demolition job on him you performed above.  How would these rightwing 'male' fanatics  feel if they went to the doctor for a genetic test and discovered genetically they were a woman... ie they had De la Chapelle syndrome  and didn't know it?    If they had two X chromosomes rather than xy.  Or if a girlfriend turned out to have Swyer syndrome and was genetically a man.  Do they even grasp what intersex is?  The proportion of humans born with divergent gender and gender identities is about the same as the number of redheads.'This whole fanatical insistence that there are only two gender states is a result of pure ignorance , intolerance and malice.",2022-03-26T23:39:48Z

"only 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOSlwtyA_M't=1m40s"">1:40' seconds in the video(I know its WRONG to comment before finishing but I'm just impetuous) and I already have to stop to thank David profusely for going into the opposition's safe space and immediately pointing out what should be obvious to everyone, but The Right is hell bent on exploiting undereducated voters, championing anti-intellectualism, disabling critical thought(crits? XD) and relying on meme for rhetoric. The question is of itself fallacious, especially in that setting, its just the distorted echo of a dog whistle. 'KBJ answered it well enough but I would have preferred an answer more like: 'For the purposes of the US Constitution and as a weight against any particular citizen's rights to self determination? No, I cannot define what it means to be a 'woman'...not for someone else. Perhaps for the purposes of a courtroom, I can draw upon, legislation, scientific factors, expert opinions, the facts of a case or precedent to make such determinations for a matter proceeding at law, maybe even if appropriate, a well esteemed dictionary but thats as far as I can expect to even intend to define that terminology for others.'' ..but you know....who says all that under pressure. or how about something like: 'I' can for myself but I don't necessarily believe its currently granted in any state's jurisdiction to make the determination for and in opposition to a private party's self determination.' 'I'm just not sure if she could accurately make that last statement...some of these nation's and states already have some fairly draconian laws on the books that people just don't even know let alone enforce.",2022-03-26T23:14:15Z

Well done David. Conservatives are aware that there are individuals borne with both male and female genitalia. aka hermaphoditisim though rare there are instances of these individuals conceiving and giving birth to healthy offspring. I guess the sensible thing would be that they get multiple choice on wether they feel more like a woman or a man that day or just simply which line is shortest. My own theory is that some people like hermaphroditism borne with both genitalia physically and people born with the wrong sense of being or maybe even both I don’t understand it but I do accept it.,2022-03-26T22:41:15Z
"The problem isn't that someone is trying to create new definitions for what a man and a woman is, the problem is we used to think we knew what they were, and we were wrong. What needs to be done it to remove the old ways of thought from the map and stop treating them like a fine set of tested and proven rules that have served us well. They failed us, it's time for ways of looking at things as they are. What we always treated as a 2 choice system is now and was always really a spectrum.",2022-03-26T22:37:22Z

David’s right, this is a trap when people like Republican senators and rw pundits ask it, but I’ve had random people on social media ask me the same question lately and you can tell that they have a very different reason for asking - because they think that “you used to be able to define it, and now we can’t because leftists have changed the definition”.

"Hey David, ''Way to go.  Great job.  I have a suggestion. ''When you appear on someone’s show put up a background image on the wall behind you.   A  banner, poster or something with the name of your show, your logo and your name.  Make it look professional.   When people are watching they will know who you are and the name of your channel.  This is good for business.   This will also  make your presentation more persuadable.   This doesn’t change the content of what you say, but the reality is, presentation and appearance matters.   ''I’m sure you are familiar with the first presidential debate on television between John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon.   Kennedy paid attention to his appearance and had experts and make-up artists prepare him for the TV cameras to look his best.   Nixon ignored this aspect of preparation and focused on content only.   People that watched the debate on television, believed Kennedy won the debate.  Interestingly, people that listened to the debate on the radio, with no visual, thought Nixon won the debate.  The point is obvious, the visual matters and can make a difference when in comes to influencing people.",2022-03-26T21:06:08Z

"Just an observation as I have had many discussions with conservatives as well. This is not to be mean but stating a pattern. The common thing with conservatives: they lack the self awareness to understand that when they ask questions, it is based on their own perspectives, definitions, and assumptions about how the world works. They don't understand that the only answer that can come out of the question they ask are the answers they want. They are just bad questions that lead you in a circle. They start with the answer and ask the question around it. Before you answer anything, you have break down the question itself. If the definition of woman is merely that they have boobs and have a vagina, you ask questions like 'what is a woman'  and expect a short answer.",2022-03-26T20:21:27Z

"A bit bizarre to me that they keep pushing the legal definition of a woman when law is about how people have been or are being treated based on the standards of society and the Constitution of America.  In no situation can I imagine saying 'Oh you're a woman as defined by Republicans, we will hear your case, or you're a woman as defined by progressives, your case is dismissed' which actually proves the whole point.  Are you going to dismiss a case because she's transgender?  If so, ya we need to broaden the definition.  If you're saying you need to know the definition to decide a case, no you don't.  You'll only need to know if the law has been withheld or not.  And for those situations where someone is discriminated against, ya, you still don't define it, you look at the letter of the law and the precedents.",2022-03-26T18:10:12Z

Maybe I'd want to know how she decides on what an appropriate sentence is, and how she reasons or computes that.  ''Now to Michael Knowles point, I may care about definition of a woman when a hypothetical case could come up whereupon that is the main defense of the defendant in question.  Perhaps a person, by all appearances looks like a man, is claiming to be a woman in order to obtain certain rights.

The only reason to debate is to assert their own 'beliefs' at any cost and prove how 'conservative' they are by standing up to 'the left'.  We are in a sick, destructive place.  Not also that you 'convinced' him that Judge Jackson's handling of leading lines of questions was good, but only because it allowed him to label her as a 'politician'.  What a schmuck.

"It seems to me that both are acting in good faith, and for certain legal purposes the definition of a woman is important. I think what David is saying is that the definition may fluctuate somewhat depending on the legal issue at hand. I'm now quoting a comment I read below which I believe would have been Pakman's best response to the question: 'Knowles' definition excludes infertile women, it excludes women who've reached menopause, etc etc. Not everything has to be simple and concrete.

I hate to give the other guy credence but I do have to admit I believe David misunderstood what he was saying when he was quoting Marsha Blackburn.

"I am a moderate because I think each of them had valid points. To he honest, Pakman was the more insulting of the two from the start. It's a valid conservative point that 'woman' is used legally, so a clear definition is relevant. It's understood that conservatives think a woman is a biological female who is born with female sex organs and characteristics (valid opinion). Pakman is correct in saying that it's unwise for a judge to define legal terms in real-time, since that can eventually be used to trap her. As a result, her Harvard education is irrelevant and she's not simply stupid for not being able to answer (as conservatives tried to imply).  The definition of woman is not simple, even biologically. The conservative definition that a woman is 'anyone that is not a man' is also too simple and kind of insulting.",2022-03-26T12:15:25Z

'And if the consensus was that my definition was to be The Definition, and you don’t fit my criteria, are you now something other than a man?'If we can agree that “woman” and “man”, as groups, are not monolith, then applying a singular description to the term seems overly basic.''I do understand how common characteristics help people (including myself) to take reasonable, assumptive shortcuts for convenience in daily life.'My experience of men, so far, builds a pattern in my brain that helps me to more quickly assess if I am interacting with a man or a woman.'Whether it is fool-proof or not, this to some degree will determine my approach to that interaction.'If my behaviour in an interaction proves to be ignorant, then I am open to understanding and correcting for that individual in the future.'But this is how I would expect a respectful interaction to be regardless of the circumstances - it’s not limited to a misstep with someone’s gender identification.''I’m not being wilfully ignorant, so maybe I just don’t understand the point of the question (or the importance of finding an answer).",2022-03-26T07:30:07Z

Everyone knows that a judge does not define things on her own, she rules on cases.  It's so easy to understand what David explained.  For example, the definition of who is considered to be a woman may be different for sports, what bathroom is used, which health of life insurance policy is offered, who can marry, etc.    i.e. for marriage and bathroom, chromosomes are irrelevant; for sports, time on HRT matters; and for health and life insurance, then chromosomes probably do matter to determine the risk profile.

"His assumption is that transgender are crazy and can't be truly telling the truth that they have female or male identities or possiblity of female or male brains trapped in the wrong bodies. Same as someone born with any other medical conditions. It's always easy to define things by appearance. Putting it this way, you're born in a body with a crippling disorder and have the ability to draw do you identify as a cripple or do you think of yourself as a artist trapped inside an unhealthy body. We as a society tend to see the cripple and not the person, the artist and thereby define someone incorrectly.  many are eager to damn the transgender community because they don't understand the suffering of being in the wrong body. Fools think because they're healthy they have ownership of what is considered healthy. In other words there is no reason to tell a person they're crippled nor is there a reason to tell a transgender female or male you're not a female or a male. It's just hate and no one has ownership of what is man or woman anyways.''Think of those born with abilities like being able to draw or compose music. That doesn't give them the right to define what is an artists only. Nor does it give them the right to say to anyone that has gained the ability to draw or compose music by education or hard work that they're are not real artist. A real artist welcomes all artist whether born or otherwise. Men and women should be thankful they're not burdened by being born in the wrong body and spend their time more wisely rather than hating others less fortunate.",2022-03-26T05:34:15Z

A distinction between a definition of sex and a definition of gender would’ve been nice. Examples of traits one would identify as defining women that would have exception in almost every case would’ve been helpful. Pointing a few out that show just how broad the definition has to be would’ve been great. Encompassing those who clearly biologically culturally socially emotionally mentally spiritually fall outside the gender binary might’ve solidified the point. You danced around it David.

They are updated, changed, as language changes, as the world changes.

"The proper answer to the 'woman' question is, If they were just asking for an 'in general' definition... not a legal or philosophical definition:''In modern society that issue has become far more prevalent and complex than it used to be, and while decades ago if you asked that question to a person on the street, the answer most likely would have been the classic idea of a biological woman.  Decades have passed though.  There has been tons of controversy over issues that circle this very idea of 'what is a women, or man, in regards to the law' with gender and biology playing massive roles in the discussion.  ''30-40 years ago, they probably would have got their answer, had that question been asked at a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court seat.... but the issue is FAR more politicized and complex now, and unfortunately that answer is no longer as simple to give.  I feel like it's still a work in progress, it's like not being able to comment on an 'ongoing investigation'... because the country, and the world, is in the messy process of trying to determine, from a legal and ethical standpoint, what those definitions are.  To give a general answer to an issue that carries such weight in today's political landscape, and is still such a debated issue, would be irresponsible of a candidate to give in a five minute response at a confirmation hearing.''That's how I look at it, anyway.",2022-03-26T04:52:03Z

"I haven’t gone through any of the other comments, but how does the right not understand that a dictionary from even 10 years ago, could have amended the meanings of any word in it because like science, things change based on new findings, reasearch. Literal, philosophical, legal, defintions etc. change , so a good rule of thumb would be keeping an open mind and a willingness to change with the times, and stop arguing about the little things that aren’t very productive. A little background, the dictionary is probably my favorite book, I have around a hundred new/vintage dating all the way back to the 1800s. So I guess you could say I’m a fan and a collector, but the common practice of amending certain definitions of words is common enough that they should stop focusing on something that changes mostly unnoticed by the general public unless an issue like this one comes up. It’s kind of funny to see how simple things have changed throughout the years. and by the way, I love your confidence in these types of debates and the way you stand up for yourself, you have wisdom and it seems more people would benefit from your calm,  collected demeanor. Just wanted to add that I love your show DaviD, I truly enjoy your opinions, and I reference you all the time in discussions political in nature.

"I don't think Michael was trying to pin him in a corner with any trickeration or 'gotcha' thing.  I understand David trying to Avoid that, as he should, as that can happen without any real motive to do so.  But I think David could have angled on it better (although sound hindsight's always better).  Here, IMO, my position in what I'd say would reflect from this POV to convey (although this is just a stream of consciousness not applicable to a talk-show quick-talk; more like it's him and I sitting at a coffee house or bar with time to kill):''Well, what is a woman vs not -- that is (also) dependent on age, in our language and conception.  Woman vs a girl on the basis of one's sex -- where 'biologically' it happens in-between junior high and high school for the most part.  Some will say not until you're 18.  Or, maybe 'fully' a woman, or man, at 21?  The definition on just this front is a bit relative.  Nobody's going to say a 2 year old's a woman, nobody's going to say you have to be 60 to be a woman.  But there is a relative 'line' between girl ' woman when their sex as a female is quite clear, and going on a biological scale or even outside of that if you wanted to get more exact, it'd be on a person-by-person basis -- not Everyone as a whole.  But there is a 'line' for everyone as a whole when it comes to legal matters, for the sake of functionality of the people.  This may sound moot at first glance, but this is to point out how things are Not 'necessarily' black and white.  You asked me to define a woman after all -- and honestly, that haziness 'line' would have to be addressed, outside a current legally-defined one.''For over 99% of the people, whether you're male or female, as in one's sex -- that has no haziness or argument, fitting any definition of male or female, broad or technical.  But not 100%, even on just one's sex.  As a key example, there are a few who are born with two DNAs, one of them clearly representing male, and one of female -- and they vary in what's produced.  What say you there?  We both would be arguing 'IF' we had to choose just ONE sex for each ONE individual of this variety (as they vary), and with some, we'd totally agree IF we had to play that board game, so to speak.  And we Both would take their overall gender (different than sex) as a person into account if they're grown up, into forming our board game positions.  So that is a hazy, albeit very small, zone on one's sex alone.  OK, you may say -- but that's a super small fraction of 1%.  Well, the point is, we can agree that's a Super small fraction, and not 100%.  There In Fact does exist a very thin line on that front where it's Literally ' Factually, not fitting any clear definition of even one's sex, let alone gender.''But is that the ONLY determining point, the DNA, on one's sex as far as what's formed as a person?  After all, the development of a being is analog, not digital.  Would we be shocked, accepting the concept of the above in mind, that there are other, albeit slim, potential caveats?  I wouldn't think so -- but that's for scientific research ' knowledge to put into play, and cases about exactly this topic depend on.  So no pre-judging here, if you catch my drift, depending on case -- even though, yes, for over 99% of the population, it's a cut and dry identifier that's fitting and uncontroversial.''And I think the above is where Gender is put into play.   As I think it'd be quite safe to assume that has more leeway than a genetic-purposes identifier.  As you could be clearly of the female sex, yet, your construct is observable from outsiders it ain't so clear.  I mean, I think given enough years in life, most of us have observed someone in the room while thinking 'Is that a dude?  Or a gal?  Shoot, wait, I'm thinking ... no, actually... hold on, I need a much better look,' while said person is projecting themselves as of any 'transexual' of any kind, but instead pretty gender neutral but in whatever fashion wear that's the norm.  And that's not by behavior, that's just what they Look like.  So obviously in the complexities within people's wiring, where there can be assumptions thrown off about them IF we analyze them as a person, etc -- things aren't always going to be black and white, even when it comes to basic concepts where for 99% of the population it is.  So could someone be/feel as the other sex that they clearly are not, when that part as usual is of no argument -- without having some mental issues being the cause?''From a biological perspective (DNA, vagina, ovaries, breasts; even if the latter 3 may not be well formed), even it's Almost always quite clear whether one's a woman, and not a man or anything in-between.  But from a by-product Being of said DNA forming them and their 'wiring' and not just in their personal, mental identification (which it's not reliant on technically; just as some people think they're straight when they're not, as one analogy) -- that has a more widened thin gap compared to biological sex.  To what degree?  I dunno, but that's moot.  Just that it can be.  I don't think one's apparent/claimed mentality in the present should = their actual gender.  But like that one person where you're like 'Is that a dude or a gal?' and having to analyze them, still being stumped and not betting the farm on your final but at least somewhat hazy conclusion -- one's gender can be different than what their DNA marker ' inner 'parts down there' may say.",2022-03-25T23:55:47Z
"David you handled this debate very well! Good job! The word “woman” by all means is not a legal term. It is not the job of judges and Justices to tell us what is the meaning of ordinary words. The job of judges is to interpret the law and tell us what the law is for a specific facts and sometimes for a general matters. If the case come in front of a judge to determine if someone would be considered a woman, then the judges will determine under applicable laws and fact findings if this person would be considered a woman by interpreting the law. And the law is legislated by lawmakers to write a law, if there would be any definition of the word “woman” in law, then it would be the job of congress, not judges.'Giving the fact that the questions was asked in bad faith, to put Judge Jackson in a political rhetoric, as you pointed out, but Judge Jackson was very smart and correct by not defining the word.

"Sure, it might be useful to have a useful legal definition of what a woman or man is.  It might also be useful to move in the opposite direction, and have no legal definition for either, and move towards making the law operate effectively with individuals being given 'personhood' or something.  Obviously there would be complications with present laws meant to protect women, and we would have to make sure that the new laws don't leave any blind spots.  I don't see why in an ideal government it would be necessary to recognize sex or gender, and with properly written laws why there would be an inherent need to have an M or F on any form of ID or certificate.  I understand that it may be a necessity under some present circumstances.  I just can't think of any reason why there would be 'no way around' having a legally recognized sex, other than 'people just need that identity'.''For instance, if there was no such legal thing as marriage, there would be no marriage inequality.  Forgive my libertarian take on that issue.  I do believe that if there is to be marriage, any adult should be able to marry any other adult.

It would have been politically dangerous to do that, and it might arguably be putting too much pre-judgement into how cases are likely to be heard, but I can imagine it.''But in a country where no almost no Republican politician is speaking or acting in good faith, where party and dishonest rhetoric is considered more valuable than duty and governance, there would be NO reason for her to answer a bad faith question with a good faith answer.''Or shorter: 'The question had only ill intentions.

"Sex Redefined: The Idea of 2 Sexes Is Overly Simplistic''As a clinical geneticist, Paul James is accustomed to discussing some of the most delicate issues with his patients. But in early 2010, he found himself having a particularly awkward conversation about sex.'A 46-year-old pregnant woman had visited his clinic at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia to hear the results of an amniocentesis test to screen her baby's chromosomes for abnormalities. The baby was fine—but follow-up tests had revealed something astonishing about the mother. Her body was built of cells from two individuals, probably from twin embryos that had merged in her own mother's womb. And there was more. One set of cells carried two X chromosomes, the complement that typically makes a person female; the other had an X and a Y. Halfway through her fifth decade and pregnant with her third child, the woman learned for the first time that a large part of her body was chromosomally male. “That's kind of science-fiction material for someone who just came in for an amniocentesis,” says James.'Sex can be much more complicated than it at first seems. According to the simple scenario, the presence or absence of a Y chromosome is what counts: with it, you are male, and without it, you are female. But doctors have long known that some people straddle the boundary—their sex chromosomes say one thing, but their gonads (ovaries or testes) or sexual anatomy say another. Parents of children with these kinds of conditions—known as intersex conditions, or differences or disorders of sex development (DSDs)—often face difficult decisions about whether to bring up their child as a boy or a girl. Some researchers now say that as many as 1 person in 100 has some form of DSD.''Could you be a Chimera?'''https://youtu.be/8WsF9Z4B7T8"">https://youtu.be/8WsF9Z4B7T8'",2022-03-25T19:25:01Z

"Copy and pasted(I’m dyslexic as hell)'Comment from below, don’t fall for sneaky tricks in debates to smear the other speeker''Tronkoop'1 hour ago'At 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwOSlwtyA_M't=6m28s"">6:28', Michael Knowles says Marsha Blackburn didn’t ask for the biological definition or the dictionary definition. That’s what KJ added. She said “I’m not a biologist” But all Marsha Blackburn asked was “Just tell me what a woman is''After this, Knowles goes on to list any definition that could have been given that would have sufficed as an answer to Blackburn’s question i.e. philosophical, legal, constitutional etc. Knowles was trying to point out to David that Blackburn wasn't asking for the legal definition. He had clearly stopped quoting her at this point. When David jumped on him for it, Knowles quickly tried to clarify that he wasn't saying she said that, just that those were sufficient answers to the question because the question was simply 'What is a woman' and left open to interpretation from there.'''Let's try to understand what people are saying at not call people 'clowns' simply because you don't understand what they are saying.",2022-03-25T18:08:16Z
Blackburn said what is a woman. Then said..you can't tell me what a woman is? She did NOT say define or legal,2022-03-25T18:07:36Z
"Here's an example of when Pakman says these types of questions are designed to 'back her up into rhetorical corners.' When Michael Knowles defines a woman as 'a female human being, and a female is of or denoting the sex that can bare children and reproduce and produce eggs.' he is demonstrating a position as Pakman describes as being 'dishonest or ignorant.' Some Woman, like men, are born sterile, are they not actually woman? Many woman are in menopause and cannot reproduce, are they not actually woman? Woman are born with all the eggs they will have, they produce eggs like you produce kidneys, are NO woman ACTUALLY woman? Well of course this is all absurd, but it indicates that Knowles is not arguing with reason and therefore should not be taken seriously on this issue. Judge Jackson wants to be considered based on her rulings as they pertain to the merits of actual cases and will not open herself to this type of criticism. This is why she got bipartisan support, including from Sen. Lyndsey Graham, on the apelet court appointment, because she can be taken seriously unlike this guy.",2022-03-25T18:07:24Z

This is the perfect example of why Dave doesn't like 'debating' with far-right wing conservatives. Dave gave a detailed explanation of why that question is completely irrelevant and the circumstances under which a judge would need to consider the rights of an individual's self-expression.,2022-03-25T17:15:05Z
"The right's definition is often clunky because the division has appeared so obvious that we didn't define it in law.'But what they mean is women/girls are people with bodies oriented towards gestation while men/boys are people with bodies oriented towards impregnating regardless of functionality. Intersex people are rare, but even then the majority strongly align one way or the other. Gender is not apart of their model, but they would recognize masculine or feminine personalities can be exhibited by either gender though most often align to sex. This is the steel man of the sex/gender binary.''The left doesn't and cannot define it concretely because they don't accept the sexual roles as being what defines gender but rather the individual's persistent and sincere identification with a gender which is hypothesized to be psychologically real. Sex is considered as separate from gender. So man/woman or boy/girl are gender, and I'm not sure if the left has a strong definition about sex but they tend to recognize a trans woman has male anatomy. So maybe they'd think sex is male/female and gender is man/woman but they leave lots of room for identifying intersex and nonbinary as third options or along a spectrum that is nuanced.''Both perpectives have their benifits. The right's definition is clearer, but the minority of intersex that doesn't fit are termed as abnormalities or deformed. Abnormal gender expression is also suppressed and labeled as mental illness. For those that don't fit, it is not so pleasant if therapy doesn't resolve dysphoria. The right would say that's just an ugly reality. While the left inclusive definition covers the minority with compassion when in good faith, this will run into confrontation with the majority. Only women's spaces and competitions are threatened because males in general are more dominant and aggressive but not always. It is easy to stand on either side if you or anyone you know are not suffering consequences, so neither side in good faith is acting against someone's rights but for someone's rights.",2022-03-25T17:12:26Z

It’s a fair question. Our society has completely eradicated the definition of “woman.” It’s not that the meaning is complicated. It’s that there is no meaning.''Defining “woman” as “a person who identifies as a woman” is like saying a ball is “anything that’s a ball.”''As someone who will have to weigh in on topics that involve women it would be nice to know if she believes there’s an actual definition to this word.,2022-03-25T14:32:50Z

",,...That's the great thing about America...''You do know that you do not hold exclussive rights on freedom of speech, right.''Besides, US has a quite stained history regarding this liberty of speech; if you held certain politicl views during the 50-70's, you were quite likely to be pursecuted by the state. Also you have taken this liberty away from several foreign countries only to install dictators who limited freedom of speech, simply because they did not comlpy with your own economical (repeatedly disproven) theories.''So what is actually the most important to you 'americans'? The maintainance of freedom of speech or right of your state to take limit that due to political fear?''Another aside - do your really think that unlimited freedom of speech has actually brought about only good results? You are hereby giving people a responsibility that they do not have to take, in that they can utter any kind of falsehood or lunacy publically and face no consequences for that.''Maybe you could institute, or rather expand on the already existing however rarely upheld, laws on libel. Would have saved you from Trump as well as a s... load of other political initiatives that were pushed through due to outright lies. Dare I say 'Iraq', 'trickle-down economics', basically anything M.T. Green does and says and a long list can be added to this.'Think about what you could have avoided if Limbaugh, Jones and other biggots weren't able to spew all their hate through made-up talking points, because it is just not in accordance with reality. Relity, that should always be regarded as more valid than held beliefs or religion.'So just because your invisible sky-friend tells you that 'homosexuals are wicked and tearing the fabric of society', this cannot be held up to whom homosexuals really are (i.e. as plentyful a variation of individuals as the rest of us) and thus these hate-preachers should (could) be held to justice.''But within your current system of legislation, anyone who wants it has the right to mislead, lie and, as we've seen of late, stir people up to such a frenzy that they turn to violence. Especially when it is so emensely difficult to sue an individual for encouragement to violence, even though it is rather obvious to everybody else, how a perpetrader may have actually been guilty in this...''So, just asking...",2022-03-25T14:16:20Z

In order to fit his SECOND definition, if a 'person who is not a man' ie. boy, post menopausal female, a 2 year old girl,  we have to admit that these are ALL also NOT women ( since the cannot 'bear children')  If the host wants to be honest they should admit that the strange focus in a SCOTUS confirmation hearing on the definition of the word 'woman' that he anxiously hopes to hear from KBJ, is a bit disingenuous.",2022-03-25T13:49:32Z

"I believe this is the kind of crap liberals fail at. The general voting  population today is not okay with the blurring of these lines. This what is a women as petty and ignorant as it is will have huge impacts politically against the left. It is like gay marriage in Obama's time. He couldn't support it because the voting population was not ready for it. The same is true for Liberals (Democrats as a whole) who don't identify this will be crucified in the ballot box. Losing on crap like this only allows more shifting to the right economically which is the real kick in the ass. It is a fine line to walk, because like gay marriage keeping pressure on it does help shift opinions. However, it can also  backfire seriously like defund the police. For her part I do believe it would be better to lie and say in her mind she sees a women as someone with female genitalia. Yes you will piss off the left and your supporters but if it gains you 2 or 3 Republicans you may gain what you need for confirmation. From there you can always say that from a legal standpoint you see it differently. Either way it is a game of strategy and Democrats suck at it.",2022-03-25T13:37:42Z

I am not saying this to be harmful, and I would like to see her answer this, and yes, if they track it to Rome, boys were with men; girls with females until maturity. The aim to reunite the two halves was ultimately their goal. To be the manliest man was to be a person from a pairing of two men, the feminine female is a female from a pairing of two females, and then the third pairing was male and female.

I think we confuse personality with gender. You can be born with a penis and have a feminine personality. You can be born with a vagina and have a masculine personality. Who you are as a person has little to do with your genitals. Who you are as a reproductive being has everything to do with your genitals.

Friggin Jackson is light years ahead of the “I like Beer” justice and the insane zealot that got rushed in faster than any justice ever before.  Amy Coney Barret looked damn near clueless up there and they barely gave her any time to prepare because they needed to confirm her in record speed before Biden could pick the justice.  Going back on their BS “We should NEVER EVER EVVVVEEERRRR choose a justice seat in the last year of a presidents term for its the people that chooses the next president that should choose the next justice.”  That POS Lindsay GramCracker that crumbles like a house of cards whenever big daddy tRump is around said that “you can use my words against me if we ever try to seat a justice in the last year of a presidency” just for him to literally do a 180 the next time a justice seat became available and rushed one in with barely a month left when it takes a few month at least to vet them.

"Quite simply there is no absolute definition that is able to define what a woman is, or what a man is to come to that, which is capable of including all cis-women inside the definition but exclude Trans-women unless they are specifically excluded as a part of the definition. There are always exceptions to any definition that would result in the inclusion of trans-women when those excluded cis-women are also included. The trouble is that while people like to believe that humans only come as XX-Females and XY-Males, they don't. Biologically humans are a spectrum with a strong bias towards XX-Females and XY-Males, but there are many people that end up in the middle of the spectrum and don't fit either of those two things. Gender is simply not a true binary regardless of how you look at it.",2022-03-25T11:05:48Z

"Blackburn got a dose of her own medicine. As a lawmaker, it's her job to define words and describe items when writing law. It's the judges job to interpret the law written based on the description of words/terms in the law.  Spoiler alert: Black's Law Dictionary is not the law!!!''Let's say Blackburn writes (and has passed) a law that says the color of the sky is green. It's then the Judges job to rules on that law based on the fact that the color of the sky is green (according to the law).  It has nothing to do with the fact that the color of the sky is different from the color green.''Now, does that mean that Judges don't go back to use dictionary terms published 200 years ago?  They have, but did you also know that Congress can pass law and prohibit SCOTUS from ruling on said law?  Yes they can and the Constitution gives them that power.",2022-03-25T07:04:45Z

"As an academic, I do define words, and in a different way to the dictionary ones. There's of course a role for definitions but like was suggested for 'love', there is a total inadequacy of using the dictionary definition to somehow capture a concept in all its parameters and sense and uses and so on. The dictionary is used as a part of definition, and even two dictionaries, particularly a dictionary for the lay population and the ones that biologists or other specialists use are wholly different. And definitions used in academia are always tentative, open to change in the light of new insights. Before we know about chromosomes, definitions of women do not include XX verses XY forms, which are realistically the closest the definition gets in modern biology that normally comes up in discussions, and that use has problems anyway, when the expression of the genes on the chromosomes give rise to hermaphroditic people. In such cases, the person where sex is interminate is decided, by judgement, to fill a box on a birth certificates in many countries, since they do not have a third category. So there are these cases in real life where doctors cannot tell, to my knowledge. And it would be unlikely even for definitions within political ideological groups for definitions to be the same. There's a theory about ribs and roles in Creation apparently that captures as what we do not think is a fundamental characteristic, but is also not observed, a missing rib that held for a duration. But the most important thing about definition is the definition of definition itself. This should be thought of as 'adding definition' to a picture that is unclear. The dictionary definition is part of that maybe, the specialist one another, different individual or professional perspectives may add more, observation and the state of knowledge in a civilisation or even a group might also affect it. And what you are looking to use the definition for matters too. If we want to define a woman for the purposes of catching a criminal as they run from police, it is sufficient to have a sense they may run in a particular way due to hip formation, they might have visible breasts, long hair, dress in a way. What is is knowing the chromosome form on scene, when there's no way of determining that whilst they run. It is sufficient to use one definition for the purposes of the chase. Another in a court room, if necessary, when you have done tests to meet a stricter criteria. I have not heard anyone do for this purpose, presumably because we have a general sense of if someone is a woman or because we just go with whatever is on the birth certificate without further question. Defining an atom at primary school is different from defining it at CERN. Neither wrong, but less precision. If the judgment is around reproductive facility that aspect of definition is more important in being denied fertility treatment than if it is about bullying at work, perhaps. I don't know. Think 'definition' as 'high definition' and how you resolve the details on a TV, and which details matter depends, almost always, on the thing you need to look at.",2022-03-25T07:03:33Z

The whole reason for defining words is to have a shared meaning that properly represent reality and to properly communicate with and understand one another.   I use to have a bit of respect for Packman because he seemed like a nice guy but this whole refusal to not define words and labeling it a 'bad faith rhetorical technique' is garbage. If you use a word in a way that doesn't make sense to me, I want to know what you think it means so I can understand if it logically makes sense with what you are trying to communicate to me. By refusing to define a word or sharing your sense of what it means you are just flat out refusing to communicate. 'I don't do dictionary, I do politics.'  No David you can't even define 'politics' as to engage in them. You can't do anything if you don't define words and at least attempt to communicate them properly. Pathetic.",2022-03-25T05:44:42Z

I mean, the question is disingenuous and time-wasting, and only relevant to…perhaps 0.00001% of cases?  And yet, senator after senator, ploughed on with a scripted concerted plot-line, wasting time on a microscopic issue, in a niche area of cases.  ''Aside: in IT work we had a variety of connectors, they literally are termed ‘male’ and ‘female’ depending on if they had a sticky-out bit or not…then one day a guy hands me the wrong connector, and I say I wanted the male one.  But, this one did have a sticky-out bit, and the other a shroud, but I said no, I mean the pronged one…quite literally the one with prongs sticking-out, had a shroud around it, thus making it we decided, a female ‘package’ or ‘envelope’ housing a male or pronged connector part!''And, with that, we settled to the level we required, the question of male and female, for our specific niche purposes.  And if a guy asked me this at interview, I’d have an answer, but be thrown by them spending important interview time asking that, instead of ‘Can you explain briefly what a RAID server is?’.  These senators could have asked about a really important commonplace point of law, to help educate the viewers/voting citizenry, but instead wanted to show tomfoolery and twitter-hits were more vital to them.

Does he at least know the cherry is worth 100 points, but what is the political definition of 'points' if it doesn't mean anything to politicians? His defense is literally the same as these so called 'rhetorical' questions. We just simply want to know what by their view these words are to even comprehend them, but to them, these words are putty, capable of being moldable to their politics.

And Knowles trying to relay the question to Pakman implied that Blackburns question was open to any definition whether it be scientific or lay.''To say she is more qualified than the 9 judges on the court is a farce. Half the CV they laid out as qualifications was complete joke. Who cares that she went to a public high school or served on the sentencing commission. Those are completely irrelevant to being on the supreme court as were many of the other things laid out. And big whoop that she went to Harvard. As Thomas Sowell says, 'The road to hell is paved with ivy league degrees!'''Bottom line is she thinks the Constitution is living and it's not. It's a contract between us and the government. Contracts have fixed meanings. The people who say it's living only do so because they have a specific policy objective and they choose to basterdize the document to achieve their ends. Anyone who thinks that was is wholly unqualified to serve including Jackson. ''Biden only picked her for being a black woman and he specifically said so on the campaign trail and yet she cant even provide a basic definition of what a woman is even though thats 50% of the reason she was picked. ''She dodged the question for political purposes period. You dont need to be a mathematician to add 5 and 5 together and you dont need to be a biologist to define what a woman is. I know shes a political hack, but id have at least respected her answering the question.''Its funny how liberals think Republicans are dragging her through the mud by actually asking substantive questions about her record, but it's fair game to trump up sexual assualt allegations against Thomas and Kavanaugh.

But I know one when I see one.”  Case closed.",2022-03-25T01:52:05Z

"Good job David! Personally, I don't care how a person wants to identify themselves, but I do think that there are reasons to define gender in law and things like some sporting events. I do think there should be 'women only' clubs and gatherings and events and organized sports that should have the right to enforce gender based rules.  Boxing for example. I don't think males should be competing against females in the female divisions.  And that's true with many sports and sporting events. We have tons of data to verify this.''That said, it's obvious this is an issue that needs to be confronted and dealt with so I don't feel compelled to not have an opinion on this. The right is trying to use this issue as a 'gotcha' so let's just confront it.",2022-03-25T01:38:53Z

Good job David - I think you did the best anyone could in that situation.,2022-03-25T01:36:26Z
"Here is my take. So you look up the definition of 'women' you will find it means 'female adult human' if you look up 'female' you get the definition 'a person who produces eggs or can bear children'. So in this context what do you call a person who isn't a dictionary definition of man or women? What happens if they are infertile? ''Now let's talk about genetics being what defines a man or women, this can quickly become a mess when you research and find in rare cases men can have XX chromosomes as well as XXY, XY, XXY, XXXY so on so forth, and women can have XX, XXX so on so forth. A single X chromosome can indicate either a man or woman. So both X, and XX can produce either a male or female person.''Making laws around definitions or whether you have the right genetics are both terrible ideas as clearly groups are going to be incorrectly assigned and laws will be incorrectly enforced.",2022-03-25T01:35:43Z

I refuse to allow media pundits to pigeonhole me or anyone else into a stereotypical description and become a new target for the latest ridicule. I refuse to let it be that easy.''

They do not describe ideas and concepts, in fact they actually show and tell people what to think and how to feel about each day's happenstance with stories that are intended to lead people into thinking and believing whatever the boss thinks and wants you to believe, but mostly and invariably confusing people, by getting people believing they are losing money or jobs or something else they believe is essential, like peace..., actually they never talk about PEACE.'The Honorable Ketanji Brown Jackson answered each ridiculous republican question as an Honorable Justice of our US Supreme Court should answer.

"Growing up it really was a question, 'what's it mean to be a man?' and I think its a question a lot of young boys spend time thinking about. Some people say, simplistically, that a man is a boy who finally had sex with a girl. Others might start listing a set of virtues like, 'a man is strong', 'a man is courageous', or 'a man stays until the job is done'. Regardless, until politics came to it, simply have a dick swinging 'tween your legs was insufficient.''After a while I've come to believe, with all the things going on that the question is irrelevant. I've seen courageous females and comforting males. I think it's pretty prejudiced to use a word like man or woman to describe the attributes of a whole population. If I came up for an answer to 'what's it mean to be a man?' who am I to project that onto another, and what right does anyone else have to tell me what the answer to that question is and why I should fit it? I've come to believe I was asking the wrong question the whole time, and the better question is 'what's it mean to be Corry.'''There's people out there in female bodies saying they're men trapped inside those bodies and vice versa. Who are they to tell anyone what those words should mean either?  And who is anyone else to tell them? For those that go through hormone therapy and surgery to make their body fit their ideal, in my case, this is America, do what you want. Wear a strap on under your pants or cut your dick off, cut your tongue down the middle, get horns surgically grafted to your forehead,  give yourself huge tits, change the shape of your nose, get a facelift, get a tattoo, get some piercings... I don't care, that's your body. But I don't think self identity comes from the shape of your body but from the person that lingers inside it, no matter where they are, what body they're in, or what they're made of.",2022-03-24T23:29:39Z

The point being is David like other leftists want to be as broad and vague as possible so they can slither any direction they need to without being pinned down. There’s no objectivity. It’s all subjective. And there might not be an official legal definition of a woman because humans until 2 seconds ago could very easily define a woman with it being self evident.

"I am proud of you David.  At the very end you were starting to say that the dictionary is printed by man.  You hit the head on the nail!  Language is not static.  Even definitions of the same word can change.  Language grows and changes and is a reflection of the population for that time, and that time only. As our consciousness grows and expands, so does our language.   Thank you David.❤",2022-03-24T22:50:02Z

He literally said, “I don’t do dictionaries I do politics,” and, “I spend very little time defining words.” Protagoras couldn’t have said it better! ''Then he accused Michael and the right in general of making a bad-faith rhetorical point about the definition of woman when it’s plainly a serious and necessary analytical observation if the debate is to remain rational - to which David and all the left has nothing but an empty rhetorical response (which is why they attack motives ad hominem rather than actually answer the argument).

"I enjoyed this. I wish David had thought to ask “did senators ask Amy Comeu Barrett what her definition of a “baby” is? Or “human being” is?”  Because those are trick questions too. Conservatives want to say that fetus are babies and human beings. But ACB couldn’t say that because that brings on whole other legal issues, and it would also show her hand on her abortion rulings that might come up. And If a fetus is human or a baby, is that from the point of conception? Can a woman who is one month pregnant get life insurance for her baby and collect if she miscarries? As far a “woman”, ignoring trans issues for a bit, there are many intersex people born who are biologically both male and female.",2022-03-24T22:25:18Z
"An interesting fact, which I encourage anyone to look up, is that the word 'man' was used for a long time to mean both what we today call a man and a woman. It did not mean a male person. It just meant a person. 'The word 'waer-mann' later came to referred to a male parson until, about 1300 CE, it eventually became 'man'. Similarly the word 'wif-mann' was used ant it too changed and became woman, and the first part of the word 'wif' became 'wife', which for some time referred to a woman until it came to mean the spouse of a male person.'The argument that a woman is a person who is not a man is nonsense if one is looking for a definition. In the past a 'person who is not a man' would have meant, a person who is not a person.'That might explain a lot about the difficult personal and legal lives of women throughout the ages.'What for me is most interesting is that Judge Jackson could have told an undetectable lie in her answer, and given a definition that Sen. Blackburn would have found pleasing and acceptable. It would have sufficed for the purposes of the hearing in that it would have neutered the question, so to speak. Judge Jackson could then go on to ignore whatever definition she gave to placate Sen. Blackburn and gotten on with the rest of her life. 'She didn't lie, she didn't neuter the question or placate the Republican Senators. She told it as she saw it. Politicians sometimes, often I'd guess, don't recognise honest answers because they have programmed themselves to deal in trickery.",2022-03-24T22:25:17Z

"Did he just say that dictionaries can be prescriptive? He is joking, right? I mean... there is such a thing as prescriptive definitions but they have a very narrow scope and certainly don't apply to the common use of ANY word in the English language.''Like... which dictionary gets to PRESCRIBE the common meaning of a word? Who gave them the authority to do so?

"'The appeal to definition (also known as the argument from dictionary) is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone’s argument is based, in a problematic manner, on the definition of a certain term as it appears in a dictionary or a similar source.''The main problem with such arguments is that dictionaries are descriptive in nature, rather than prescriptive, meaning that they attempt to describe how people use the language, rather than instruct them how to do so in a definitive manner.''Accordingly, dictionary definitions don’t always reflect the meaning of words as they’re used by people in reality. This can happen for various reasons, such as that the dictionary definition doesn’t list all the connotations of a word, or that the dictionary definition doesn’t capture the new meaning of a word that has been recently turned into slang.''Furthermore, another notable problem with appeals to definition is that different dictionaries can list different definitions for a given term, and even a single dictionary can have multiple definitions for the same term.''Accordingly, it’s generally fallacious to claim that any single definition is the right one. Furthermore, in many cases, such claims involve fallacious cherry-picking, where people pick the definition that best supports their stance out of the ones available to them, while ignoring others.''Because the appeal to definition is problematic, and because this fallacy is frequently used in discussions on various topics, it’s important to understand it. As such, in the following article you will learn more about the appeal to definition, and see how you can respond to people who use it.'",2022-03-24T21:58:42Z
"What he doesn't understand is that judges are there to examine evidence and consider arguments, not make pronunciations absent of nothing. I could give you my own definition of woman, and that might differ from the definition in a dictionary. That definition might differ from that in another dictionary! Furthermore, a biologist might present a much more detailed definition that goes well beyond that which we find in a layman's dictionary. If we bring all these definitions to judges, they will make a judgement, but not one that says 'This one here is the right one.' They'll say 'Based on arguments presented, in this particular circumstance, this definition is most suitable.'",2022-03-24T21:57:56Z

It would be a laborious thing to do.''WOMAN must have:'- breasts (unless she doesn't)'- long hair (unless she doesn't)'- vagina! gotta have vagina!'- no penis'- no testicles'- the estrogen'- the not testosterone'- ovaries (unless she doesn't)''But according to this 'definition' there is no inherent reason people can't be changed from a man into a woman.... a man can get a vagina installed. Some people are even born as BOTH man and woman. There's a lot that just doesn't compute here. The conservatives don't even know the answers to the questions they're asking, they're just going for superficial 'gotchas' which appeal to their audience of lame brain-dead sponge cakes.",2022-03-24T21:55:39Z

I can imagine the headline on Michaels video “Liberals gets DEMOLISHED and can’t define what a woman is!!!“,2022-03-24T21:50:04Z
"To understand the definition of 'woman' you must understand the basics of gender. To make it easy, gender is not the body parts that define your sex. The vagina and penis do not determine your gender. Gender is the role a person plays in society. And that inherently is defined by a person's culture. For instance, in India they recognize three genders culturally. Man, woman and a third gender group called Hirjas, comprised of transgender,  eunuchs and intersex people. Traditionally, many in the Hirja community dress up with glitter and makeup and go to events like a marriage or birth to lighten the mood and bless those in attendance. They use their status to make money on the streets by offering blessings or curses. In Hinduism, they are recognized as people who have the ability to bless or curse you. They are revered but also feared. That is a gender role. That is what society expects of them. ''Now, back to the definition of a woman. Woman is traditionally known in America to be person who bears children and takes care of the household. The fact that a woman's role has changed rapidly in this country, working jobs and taking over a man's role, means it is harder to define what woman means legally. David didn't want to go into that obviously because this guy wasn't trying to have an honest debate and it's obvious he's taken very little, if any, time to actually read the scientific studies on gender. It's not David's job to teach him these things and frankly, it's tiring having these conversations with people who have zero interest in reality or science. Gender is a role, not sexual organs. Therefore, woman is a role in society and can't easily be defined because having a vagina doesn't automatically mean you fit that role in society (bearing children etc.)",2022-03-24T21:49:46Z
Who decides what gender a hermaphrodite is?,2022-03-24T21:48:29Z

"Even Michaels definition of women excluded billions of 'women'. A person who is not a man? What is a man? A boy isn't a man, are they women then? Being able to bear children, a lot ciswomen cant, and transwomen cant. Producing eggs? A lot ciswomen don't. Transwomen also dont.",2022-03-24T21:47:49Z
Haha. Thank you David before you said 'there is no legal definition' I was thinking the same damn thing. You hit all the Relevant... More like irrelevant questions that were asked,2022-03-24T21:47:39Z
"This host just said a woman is someone who can bear children or produce an egg etc. It’s stupid because by that definition infertility makes someone cease to be a woman or every woman ceases to be a woman after menopause, or after a mastectomy, or after a hysterectomy, or getting her tubes tied etc. Its a ridiculous exercise. We can no longer allow Physicality to determine gender identity. There’s are languages in the world that don’t even have genders. Why get so wrapped up in the stupid stuff when we can be out there building bridges - literally.",2022-03-24T21:47:05Z

"Pakman should have talked about the definition of 'Donkey Dong Doug' from the Kavanaugh hearings. Or perhaps the definition of sexual harassment during the Clarence Thomas hearings. These public display 'dressing down' events for nominees are so inane and stupid. Particularly when they are being questioned by people whose education can be nil as relates to being an elected official. Moreover, there's no reason for them to answer or tell the truth. The last 3 Republican nominees were questioned about legitimate legal issues (particularly and specifically) about Roe vs. Wade, and they all unsurprisingly answered that it was a legitimate law with numerous precedents and there wasn't even a question as to its legitimacy or enforcement. Surprise. All three of those judges 'upheld' the 6-week heartbeat law in Texas that encourages citizens to turn each other in and bans women's rights to health care procedures. Uh...perhaps the definition of a woman is more relevant than we think.",2022-03-24T21:31:22Z

"I'm a liberal... having said that, what have we come to that we can't even define what a man and a woman are?  If you are being honest, you would have to admit that it is kind of weird.  So why has this happened.  Because we now have a lot of people who are making up their own definitions of what they are.  Unless you are born without any genitalia or with both, then you are either a man or a woman.  If you have female reproductive organs, then you are a woman.  What if they were removed for some reason?  Well, there are always going to be rare instances that don't fit the mold.  We have to take them as they come and make reasonable and logical allowances.  If you are a man crossdressing as a woman, you are still a man.  You can have a sex change like Bruce Jenner and I am fine with allowing him to now classify as a female.  So what we have is a base definition based on genitalia at birth and then occasional circumstances that we have to make allowances for.  So what happens when a man has a sex change and becomes a woman and he wants to compete against other women in a contact sport?  First of all, how often does this even come up?  It is not exactly a huge problem but it also depends on the type of sport.  Wrestling can be problematic but basketball and baseball, sounds fine to me.  What is happening in our society is that there are a lot of new ways of thinking and being that are clashing with the old ways.  There are valid points to be made on both sides.  It should not be all one thing or all another.  There has to be compromise and it may not always go your way.  But compromise and reasonable solutions to our problems is not on the table right now.  Everyone is in their corner snarling at the other side, and this narrative sells well for the media, better than peaceful solutions.  Who wants to hear about that?  We're more interested in hearing about conflict.",2022-03-24T21:21:12Z
"None of these stories playing out in the world are real.  Yet we all still like to be a part of one side or another.  There are no sides, just made up stories.

We are not alone but we are shunned (but highly loved) as a race because we are destructive and unconditional love isn't in play!  Oh well, maybe in another 200 years we will be welcomed as a race of unconditional beings of love and not seen as a  reactive, war mongering bratty race who hurt with words and kill with weapons!!!????",2022-03-24T21:21:04Z

"As a philosophy teacher, I can honestly say that the idea that the judgment of Merriam-Webster exhausts the meaning of words is a common display of ignorance - though I'm never surprised to hear it from the 'science-loving' essentialists on the right. Words are always defined by fallible human beings. The whole idea of dictionaries and encyclopedias has been criticized from its MODERN inception for just that reason. Granting greater authority to publishing companies than, say, philosophers, poets, artists, or even just the culture at large is a relatively recent historical idea borne out of this rigid essentialism which the right has come to embody. Any philosopher worth his or her salt, from Plato to Heidegger, is preoccupied with the experiential meaning of words, not with what absolutists prescribe. '         I'd recommend to David that he press further on this idea of defining 'Woman.' Ask these people how they define it. You will be surprised to find that when pushed on such questions, they often become much less sure of themselves. For example, I haven't met many people who want to argue that gender is 100% defined by one's anatomy, and yet the essentialism quickly starts to crumble once you start trying to combine non-physical traits into a genetic essence.",2022-03-24T21:06:06Z

Why don’t you invite Vaush?!!!'He will teach you a thing or two or a million since you can’t seem to realize how dumb you sound. 'Awwwww! You can’t say what a woman is?!!! You seem so uncomfortable with it… because you are so bigoted my man.,2022-03-24T20:48:45Z
Good shot at a discussion. Do it again,2022-03-24T20:48:35Z
You can't define something but what it isn't. Why can't he give the definition? Courts decide but facts or evidence brought to them. He is a joke. You put him in his place and he doesn't even know it.,2022-03-24T20:48:22Z

Come on David''This is easy'A transperson is someone of sex A who identifies as gender B'A transman is a woman who identifies as a man'In the same way that a furry is a human who identifies as another mamal.'But a furry isn't actually a wolf. They are a human''You lost the argument as soon as you refused to accept that a woman is an adult human female. And I can not get over the sexist idea that being a man or woman means adhering to the gender stereotypes. It's just bizarre that people on the left support such a position 🙄,2022-03-24T20:46:00Z

You don’t understand what they are saying?!! You are admitting you are dumb…,2022-03-24T20:45:48Z
Good job David!  This was fun to listen to since you identified the hole he wanted you to fall in and told him why you weren’t playing that game… he of course had to end as top dog with calling KJB a politician… all word games to feel superior,2022-03-24T20:45:23Z

"I have known very intelligent conservatives in my life.  This man has not shown himself to be one.  I believe he must have recognized that David's argument really could not be refuted.  Of course, the purpose of such questions was simply to feed the rage, fear, and angst of the right-wing base who, I understand, are only being shown edited portions of the questions and answers from the hearings.  It is quite silly, really.  The judge, when seated as a Justice will still be part of a progressive minority on the bench.  But the Senators who sought to destroy her credibility may only have succeeded in further destroying their bases belief in democracy.",2022-03-24T20:45:11Z

Republicans know what they're are trying to do and I bet this guy does too. What has defining a woman got to do with her job? What they were trying to do was to drag her into discussion about transgenders and no matter how well she answers they'll still find something bad to say about it.

"Judge Jackson declined to answer, possibly aware that a case about the definition of 'woman' under the law might soon reach the Supreme Court.

Michael never said Blackburn explicitly asked Jackson to give a biological or any other specific definition of a woman… He said she asked her to give ANY definition and then listed like 5 categories in which she could have given one.

Only the bottom 25% of human intelligence is confused about gender identification. The other 75% accept someone elses self-image for what it is. I don't want to waste time on your sex life (unless we both choose to do so). I don't care what turns you on regardless of your reproductive organs. Your heterosexuality or homosexuality isn't worthy of running through my brain...It's a moronic time waster.'Doesn't this guy have anything IMPORTANT to occupy his waking hours??? Is his primary point of 'intellectual' focus on human crotches???'Definitely a bottom 25%er (maybe a bottom 10%er).,2022-03-24T20:15:15Z

"Caveats :'1) I am centrist w/ views up to 1 standard deviation to either side depending on issue.'2) Michael Knowles is right-leaning and IMO generally bad faith'3) David Pakman is left-leaning and IMO generally honest''I think both commentators are correct in a narrow sense but also dance around the other's points. The trans movement has expanded the popular definition of a woman to a more inclusive but less concrete (and imo less coherent) conceptualization of the word. There are problems with this new definition that Republicans and Knowles enjoy harping on. The fact that KBJ chose to sidestep the question of womanhood illustrates the messiness of the topic. Don't believe me?  Think about when Lindsay Graham asked her (inappropriately) about her religious faith. If she was a practicing Wiccan it might have been wise to avoid answering directly but instead she humored him by mentioning she was Protestant which is not controversial. David was absolutely correct to point out that the questions asked of her were in bad faith and had no bearing on the position she was applying for. It was frustrating to watch these guys harp on her in what was unveiled partisanism and political theatre--not, unlike the political circus surrounding the Brett Kavanaugh nomination but that's another story.''Anyway, these hearings serve almost no purpose other than to grandstand in front of one's base.",2022-03-24T20:11:45Z

So what about women who can't reproduce or don't produce or have eggs?'This 'very simple' question is more complex than it seems and can be looked at from multiple angles. Cultural, biological, legal, etc. as was even admitted by Knowles in this very clip. So why pretend that this is a 'very simple' question and that 'the' definition of 'woman' is easy to give.

Michael was quoting Marsha Blackburn 'What is a woman' and then followed with his own list of suggestions, (legal, philosophical etc). I think he meant to say 'it could be a legal, philosophical definition' as a suggestion not as a continuation of Blackburn's quote. Also, Michael is right to say prescriptive not proscriptive as David said. Prescriptive is the correct term as it refers to  prescribing a definition. Proscriptive refers to prohibiting something.

"There is no definition of a woman that any human can give that would not exclude someone from that category that the definer knows is actually a member of that category. I reviewed the video word by word, and I notice that Michael never states his definition of a woman. He states what he calls 'The old definition', and as a person that can bear children, and produce eggs. But he never states that this is his definition. I think it would be safe to assume it is his definition, but I won't do that because he didn't say it was. But let's look at why that definition isn't correct because it excludes people that we all know are women. There are many women that don't produce eggs, and are incapable of bearing children. Where do they go? And this goes for every single definition of a woman that anyone can make. We all have our own personal definitions of what a woman is. For me, a woman is any person that claims membership of that group exclusively, and accepts the responsibilities, and disadvantages inherit with that role, alongside the other members of the group. This does not mean that they can't work alongside their group members to alleviate disadvantages, but they may take no action that alleviates those disadvantages for them alone. To do so would place them outside of the group. Even this very broad definition would still exclude some people that I know are women, but it is as close as my small brain can come to an all inclusive one.",2022-03-24T19:59:03Z

From there it's easy to point to the bizarro need for defining sex in rigid terms, and how in the final analysis it is simply an effort to discriminate against those who don't fit a traditional (and overly simplistic) worldview.",2022-03-24T19:51:43Z

The crux of gender-based laws is that a law can not be established that would discriminate based on gender.  So, if a woman or transgender man or any other gender classification sues based on a gender-based law, it won't even be discussed what gender the plaintiff is...only whether the law has a discriminatory factor.''That being said, David did a very poor job in this clip.

"Obviously Michael is a bad faith clown. I agree with David on the strategy line of reasoning for Judge's hearing. However, DP's mistaken on his recent claims that he 'doesn't do definitions'... philosophy (which David cares a lot about) consists of clarifying language. Pakman does this all the time, e.g. when he distinguishes between 'democratic socialism' and 'social democracy' or a host of other terms. Pretending its pointless to define terms just isn't historically honest with his approach. He could explain equivocation fallacies, and discuss how word usage/definitions change depending on the subject and context (e.g. genetics, biology, colloquially, socially, etc.), and how the word 'woman' doesn't have to refer to an organism's gametes.",2022-03-24T19:48:27Z

For example, when Michael said we do need the term 'woman' defined because there are laws that specifically are for women. What David should have done was ask him for an example. Take for instance Michael gave the answer 'a woman has the right to vote by law'. Ok, now insert any other human into that 'woman' space.  A black woman, a trans woman, a homosexual, a man. If the laws defines that everyone has that right, then now Michael is in a corner. David should have said 'give me a law that is specific about women that does not also pertain to men. If you cannot find a law that only includes rights for women, then what you call a woman is irrelevant.' Unless you have a law that only women are given a right or only women aren't allowed a right, then even if you deny that a trans woman is a woman, that law doesn't change because they would also have that law as a man.",2022-03-24T19:44:43Z

Who wants someone  to be a judge that has a pre-judgement in the first place?  Are the right wing judges who came before supposed to rule their opinions on anything that may come up?

"There is no legal definition of a woman because any definition would alienate someone who, by any other metric, would be considered a woman.  Michael's own definition alienates the 1 in every 5 women who are unable to have children because his definition includes ''the ability to have children.''  So where do you categorize the 33 million people who are no longer considered women, according to Michael's definition?''Fine, you may argue that a doctor can ''simply'' determine their sex based on their chromosomes.  XX for female, XY for male, right?  Well, no.  The problem is that genetics is very, very messy, and gender is simply the social construct to help define a messy subject.  Is a XX man a woman because they're genetically female, despite having a penis and testicles?  How about an XY woman?  Are they a man because they're genetically male, despite having breasts and a vagina (and in certain cases, can even have children?)  What about people with only a single X chromosome?

How about Lindsey's totally unconstitutional question about her religion? It was literally illegal as discribed in the first amendment; 'the government shall have no religious test....'.,2022-03-24T19:16:55Z
Republican objections to Katangi have nothing to do with anything but race.,2022-03-24T19:16:49Z
"David, I admire your composure.  I would have said, 'Why the f would they even ask that question?'",2022-03-24T19:16:28Z
I commend David for going on Michael's show.  I wish they would have chose a different topic to cover though.  Perhaps something about the Durham report or the massive election that's being uncovered in  States like Wisconsin where former state Supreme Court Justice gableman  Release the results of his investigation or or whistle blower Tina Peters in Colorado being punished for doing the right thing.,2022-03-24T19:16:09Z
"If someone asked her if the Earth was flat or round, and she said she didn’t know, I wouldn’t want her to be a SCJ. You could say that’s not directly relevant to be judge but so what. It’s such a dodge to try and get around her answer to try and frame it as not relevant.",2022-03-24T19:16:06Z
Fun times,2022-03-24T19:15:46Z
Dishonest or ignorant........ how about both,2022-03-24T19:15:24Z
The whole issue is ridiculous and isn't relevant. Only right wingers think David Pakmam was embarrassed herein.,2022-03-24T19:15:19Z
Michael is talking very fast. Is he afraid of what you might say?,2022-03-24T19:15:08Z
Ah he invites a lot of progressives huh? Are they actually big names like Seder or just some Randys off the side of the street?,2022-03-24T19:15:02Z
"Why do Republicans feel the need to have a hard and fast definition of a woman? Get over it already, Republicans. You're being left behind.",2022-03-24T19:14:55Z
Ouch dishonest or ignorant -- kinda sorta kidding around,2022-03-24T19:14:51Z
"The trans flame war is the major obsession of reactionaries, becaause (a) Culture wars are all they have left since their economics went down the toilet. (b) It's more contentious and less resolved than racism / gay rights etc. It's an easier thing to knock. (c) Aspects of the TRA case, in a minority of cases, are nutso - it's an easy target and thereby a soft underbelly towards the other issues. ''In fact, gender is largely a steam pile of patriarchal bunk. This is what the reactionaries need shoved down their throats. We can agree about sex as binary (except a very small amount of cases), but sex and gender are very separate things. The amount of people on all sides who confuse the two is staggering. this doesn't mean that medical treatments aren't appropriate in some cases. It doesn't mean there are unresolved tensions around single sex spaces, sports etc. But the whole thing is blown out of proportion by zealots on at least 3 sides (TRA, Gender Crtitical, conservative). It's the conservatives that are having a field day, with ammo we hand to them. But the biggest gain is for social media corporations who feed off the ceaseless rancour, which is part of their business model. If you're up till 5 am arguing about pronouns and toilets - it's Twitter gaining far more than any trans person or Gender crit feminist. ''That's the problem with the 'debate' - the social media component, which will bring binary (geddit) hysteria to just about anything. ''But when a Ukranian refugee signs into Poland or Czech republlic, you can bet they ain't losing their minds about who might use a toilet next to them, or why it only says M or F on the registration form. Perspective innit.",2022-03-24T19:14:49Z
Great job David. I only wish when he mentioned how the left doesn't want to debate you brought up how you were scheduled and wanted to debate Candice Owens at Politicon and if he could pass the invitation down the (daily)wire,2022-03-24T19:14:37Z
Never heard of him.,2022-03-24T19:14:36Z
"Never debate an idiot, he will drag you down to his level ' beat you with experience.''STOP. Just stop. The Reich has zero credibility anymore. Stop entertaining the thought you can meet them halfway.",2022-03-24T19:14:35Z
Wow! He kept interrupting David. Waste of time,2022-03-24T19:14:24Z
The right are so performative for their audience that it’s actually disgusting.,2022-03-24T19:14:15Z

Half way through. Gender is different from sex. Sex is chromosomes hormones and genitalia.  Gender is a construct created by people assigning characteristics. The characteristics are perceived as a spectrum to which people find themselves upon and relating to. No one except for ones self knows ones self better.,2022-03-24T19:12:11Z

How many times has that question been asked to a potential SCOTUS?,2022-03-24T19:11:47Z
"What is your experience on the court?''What cases do you remember the most and why?''Why do you believe you would be qualified to join the SCOTUS?''These are actual questions that would be asked in an interview of SCOTUS if it were bipartisan ' honest.''Asking, “What is the definition of a woman?” Doesn’t seem like a legitimate question to be asked at a job interview.''Imagine you apply to Applebee’s and instead of asking for your waiter/waitress experience they ask, “Can you define the word _____?”''It makes no sense.  Nonsense is more accurate here.",2022-03-24T19:11:31Z
