Mutilating your bodies trying to indoctrinate children in your weird fantasies to get approval and validation of your existence. It's disgusting and down right evil.

At so many points you tried to escape this particular debate by using the same strategy you claimed Jackson was using, (avoid giving an actual definition of a woman because that would put you in a delicate spot), and when that didn't work, you resorted to distort Knowles words when you said that he '... aserted that she said that she wanted the legal and philosophical definition...', (he didn't), then you acussed him of backtracking, (he didn't), and then of being dishonest, (he wasn't).'This indeed didn't go well for you, sir.''P.S.: '...we are talking man to man now...'

"I'm a fan of Pakman rather than Knowles, but this was a flop performance on Pakman's part. Knowles was being completely respectful. There's nothing wrong with defining a word for the sake of a discussion. Oftentimes words have multiple meanings or have meanings that have been misconstrued by culture that have completely lost their true meaning. Think of the word socialism for example. Socialism no longer means what it technically means to the average person. When the average (U.S.) person hears or reads the word socialism, they're more likely to think of the country's who have implemented socialism, like the USSR and Venzuela, and how it's a generally bad thing that results in a dictatorship. What socialism truly means is an economic system in which the means of production is socialized. It's important that we define words that have ambigious meanings because often times many words have multiple meanings to different people, and if we dont set out a clear defintion pf the term, any discussion regarding that term will be futile. What Knowles did was not bad faith at all.","2022-04-06

Another thing I don't understand more generally is the insistence on definitions of words being unnecessary. A word not necessitated be a definition means nothing at all, so why even have the word. If the word ‘woman’ means nothing, then why say ‘trans woman’. If ‘woman’ means nothing, then the word is completely superfluous because you’re given no more information by the presence of the word than its absence.

To ask for a definition of a woman with no qualifiers on whether you are referencing legal definitions, biological definitions, or cultural definitions at a confirmation for a JUDICIAL nominee means the default for the nominee should in fact be a legal definition which Blackburn would have attacked from the other two standpoints. It was solely meant as a dog whistle gotcha moment to make her say she believed trans women were women and then beat her over the head with it, which is to make a cultural argument that she couldn't address legal issues which would have been a non sequitur. I think the Judicial candidate showed excellent judgement in avoiding that question and, after all, her shrewd judgment is what they were there to assess.","2022-04-03

"Complaining about bad faith while at the same time comparing this interview with that crazy fucker Lee Peterson is very bad faith. Also no the questions from the senators don't need to be strictly about legal issues nor should they be. These people are some of the most important decision makers in the country. The question around what is a 'woman' is ment to expose if she cared more about activism then being an objective legal professional. Is that line of questioning trying to back her into a corner? Of course it is but It's also perfectly reasonable to not want overly emotional activist judges running the show.''Also the lefts response to the hearing was full of bad faith reactions, plenty of high-profile people called the senators racist and that's about as bad faith as you get. The hearing isn't ment to be easy, she was supposed to get grilled, part of the process is just to try and get her to react. Bad faith is not excepting that treatment for this person but being perfectly happy with all the crap Amy Barrett got in regards to her confirmation.","2022-04-02

"For someone to identify as something there first has to be a point of reference? Genders are constructed by society based on their roles and their roles were through history and evolution predetermined by their sexes. To say that sex and genders are not the same is one thing, but to claim that there's no correlation and that genders are solely socially constructed and that everyone who feels like it should be able to name their own and then that they should conform language and other people to it is nonsense. I get that they're making the whole fuss because some people are insensitive and denying that there's any such thing social construct and gender spectrum. But I don't see how it's a issue picking one of two genders/pronouns in traditional sense. It's more convenient, works for wast majority, and if you feel different and that you don't really fit into those simplified confinements you can tell it to people around you. It's a good system in place for differentiating between nice folk and assholes. If you guys in US weren't so self-centered and opted for learning few other languages you'd realize that stuff like 'they/them' don't really work in many cases.  I'm not from the states, and in our language there isn't even a word for 'female/male sex'. Word 'female' is literally translated as 'womanly', derived from the word 'woman'.

"As an example of why pinning down a specific definition is difficult/foolish/pointless:''Consider two hypothetical court cases. In the first, someone is fired and alleges that they were terminated on grounds of sexism and misogyny. So whether or not they were a woman would be extremely relevant in that case, and would revolve around social cues, like how they look, acted, and behaved, and the case would turn on how the employer acted based on those things. Even if you believe yourself to be a man and that you look, act and behave like a stereotypical man, if your boss nonetheless believes that you are a woman and fires you solely on that basis, then they are in violation of anti-discrimination statutes and will likely lose their case.''An alternative: there is a pharmaceutical diagnostics company that makes a sophisticated test to detect diseases. Some diseases appear more frequently in one gender or another, a gender being defined as a specific grouping of biochemical markers and traits. A patient is misdiagnosed by this test, is given a treatment that they didn't need, which caused side effects of which they died. It is alleged that the company negligently designed or administered their test and that it assumed the wrong gender when interpreting the results.'Gender would again be a lynchpin issue in the case, but it would have a VERY different meaning and context.","2022-04-02

Not only is possible to give a trans-friendly definition of womanhood but in some respects, it should be seen as a core project of trans-advocacy's persuasive rhetoric.''Frankly I think Pakman was fed a lay-up here (given how bad Knowles's definition was) and instead it turned into very silly mud wrestling.","2022-04-01

"From my understanding the only legal definitions in the justice system are for the procedural functionality of that said system (writ, tort, statute, subpoena, party, hearsay, docket, etc). Any other terms (eg 'women') that relate to written laws (eg title IX) are either defined in those pieces of legislation or undefined, which is when the art of litigation takes place to debate the interpretation, intent, and application of stated law(s) for a particular case scenario. So to answer the broad question, what is a woman? You need both context and a scenario. What is a woman in relation to the survival of the human race and our reproductive ability? What is a woman in relation it's significance of being in love with another person? What is a woman in relation a school's fulfillment of Title IX? The short form question is too simple to adequately answer because 'woman' has many definitions that are dependent on a particular scenario. It does make for a useful political tool because it seems like it should be easy ? to answer but in the context of law and one's qualifications to be a judge, it's is a very poorly worded question (if your intent is to actually discuss the topic vs generate political responses)","2022-03-31

"If you can't agree on the definitions of words or at least stipulate which definition you will be using in the course of a discussion, then all discourse falls apart.  I think this is at the root of all argumentation.  To refuse to agree on a definition of a term or concept simply allows one or both sides to move the goal post.  To say that he only discusses politics and won't agree to stipulate the definitions of the terms he's using is a bad faith move.  If womanhood is the issue being discussed, as with transgendered folks in women's sports, then a definition of what a woman is becomes crucial. I ask myself, which side of an issue benefits from keeping a cloud over a term or concept, and that's the side you need to pin down on clarity the most. The down side of politics being everywhere in the media is that everyone, including most commenting, think they should play politics.  There was a time when defining what being a 'citizen' meant was quite relevant to a lot of people in this country. I'm glad we pinned down a definition of that, or else I probably wouldn't be able to voice opinions at all, in this country.","2022-03-30

"I'm dumbfounded reading through these comments. 1) I really don't think that Knowles 'lost' this exchange. Frankly, I think that Pakman went out of his way to quibble about phrasing because he didn't want to actually engage with Knowles' (salient and important) point, which is that when one is the arbitrator in an issue where boundaries are being delineated, one has to be able to distinguish between the categories in question. 2) David interrupted Knowles as much, if not more, often than Knowles interrupted him (I counted). 3) Going into a conversation expecting the person you're speaking to will be acting in bad faith is actually a form of bad faith on your part; David was the one implying negative things here. 4) I hate how David's demeanor comes off as if he thinks he's the one whose side is most ethical. '''I teach at a public, division 1 university. I have two swimmers who've missed class for the past two weeks because they lost to Lia Thomas and now need counseling. I have an aunt who was an Olympic swimmer, who roundly disagrees with the idea that one should be able to compete against whom they choose; in fact, an enormous portion of sports is an act of defining precisely who one CAN'T compete with because it undermines what sports are founded on: fair competition. ''Defending a tiny minority at the expense of the majority--in a situation where it really is a zero sum game; where what's best for one group is worse for another--is unethical. I cannot understand how someone who's progressive can expect that a judge will do her best to fight sexism--to even the playing field and provide protection for rights which don't apply to men--while also being unable to express or define the differences between those categories.''Though Justice Brown's maneuvering was strategic, I don't understand how David doesn't seem to grasp the legitimacy of where Knowles is coming from.","2022-03-30

"You missed in this one. It was easy. Just challenge him to do the same thing and then take it apart. 'Woman' means different things in different contexts. Is there a hard cut off for when a girl becomes a woman? Is it legal for intercourse, legal for marriage, able to vote, menarche, 'deflowered', some feminist idea of emancipation, having a Bat Mitzvah?'' And 'the' dictionary definition? The fact that there are more than one dictionary, each containing more than one entry gives the lie to that. The debate of prescriptive/descriptive only exists in the public mind. Prescriptive went out with the Victorians and Confucius. Language does not have a spec (see the use of 'preferred' in the Chicago Manual).''And there are more than one type of dictionary-- popular, medical, biological, anthropological. If you mean the colloquial definition, you'd better go look up the squishiness of the word Colloquial. As well as Dialect, Ethnicity, and I don't know, maybe Wittgenstein.''When does a word become an 'official' word with a final fixed meaning? When the OED inducts it? Is there a ceremony? (actually there is for French, but you wouldn't want to be like the French would you?) OMG!  Things change. We learn stuff, we 'advance'. That is explicitly what the Right exists to deny and impede. Everything was better before and things are eternal. Comforting but stupid.''Until recently, homosexuality was a medical condition. It was no more a proclivity than 'people of cancer'.''What is going to happen: We're going to make up some new words. Just like we need ones for bio-mother, birth-mother, care-mother(s), and legal-mother(s). Add: 'legally adjudicated father (deadbeat-daddy), man who has acknowledged paternity (whiteknight-daddy), husband of biological mother at time of conception (cockhold-daddy) or birth (legalsystemunclearontheconcept-daddy), man listed on birth certificate (romcom-daddy), un-rebutted presumed father (jesus-daddy)'. In the same way we're going to have: bio-gender (what you've got in yer genes), expressed-gender (what you've got in yer jeans), phenotypic-gender (what you had before you wore jeans), identified-gender (what brand you've got on yer jeans), legal-gender (what the geniuses should get rid of). There isn't even a word for female human is there? ''The Right wants to dream of some definitive Platonic source (kind of handed down by God along with objective morality), that they can use to complain about kids being fast and loose with these days. ''Make the analogy to the abortion debate. The Right does not like continuums, they like bright lines. We make cutoffs for expedience when we have to, but we should not then go back and claim that that captured the heart of the matter. ''Ok fine, all of that is lovely philosophy which would make the best and brightest of the Rightosohere glaze over. So go all medical-evil on his ass.'''There is intersex.' It is a thing whether you want it or not. We have been trying to pretend this away for centuries. 'Sex assigned at birth'? At least do 'they' get to decide when they reach majority? ''There are hermaphrodites, and not just in Japanese comic books. Do they get to use either bathroom? If you bang them are you gay? If they father a child and also give birth to one they are on different certificates as a father and mother, right? No sex change needed. If they decide to cut off half their bits in order to conform to social norms 'then' they are a tranny? What was the gender that they trannied from?''There are conjoined twins. Sometimes they share a genital. But the heads express differently. The age-old question-- who is in charge, the big head or the little one?''There is XXY. There is XYY. There is XXYY and XXXY. There are 'mosaics.' Do the chromosomes get to vote each other off the island?''Zygotes are people. Pretty soon we'll be able to swap out an X for a Y. Better protect the other snowflakes by keeping the pervert on a separate petri dish.''Corporations are people. People must have a gender. Are they assigned one at incorporation or is it in their DNA?''If there was some value in nailing all this down then more power to ya.

Or the term “marriage” is defined differently now by most rational, thoughtful people than it was just a few years ago.

"The part that is “not in good faith” is that most of the uses of gender being argued are actually situations of sex not gender. We have historically used the words interchangeably, but we now all understand that is wrong. However, instead of using the correct word sex the left clings on to gender because they know that is less rigid in its definition. We don’t divide sports by gender but by sex. That’s why whenever women and men compete it is called the battle of the sexes (not genders). Spanish isn’t a gendered language but a language split by sex. Spanish words are male (masculine) or female (feminine). Gender encompasses much more than biology, but most instances where gender is being debated/applied, we mean sex. Until we all acknowledge this, we can’t have an honest discussion.","2022-03-30

How can we structure or use language if we don’t know what the hell we are talking about or referencing? It’s baffling that people do not comprehend this slippery slope of language degradation. Don’t even get me started on spelling and grammar, which seem to be non-existent... another worrisome thing for language. ''If we can’t define what a woman is or what the word “woman” means, what else can’t we define? How far will this go? Will we just remove all definitions from all words, or only the ones we don’t like? What is grass? What are colors? What is a vehicle? Do you see how silly this becomes?

"The idea that a judge should be opining about what gender is so fucking stupid. Judges on some level prescribe social categories through interpreting legislation (laws often reify social categories), but that is a side effect of answering the question a specific law may raise. Jackson was right to not answer that as that's a question to be handled by experts in culture (sociologist + anthropologist not like pundits lol) in amicus curiae briefs. But we all know how much conservatives don't want people who actually study culture to define a woman. And the medical institution intentionally has nothing to say on the subject as they focus on the female body and not culture (well this wasn't always true but medicine has changed significantly since the 1920s). ''Imagine reading a supreme court majority opinion that says 'if you don't have a vagina tough cookies you can't be a woman'. Even on the question of whether or not protections for women extend to transwomen it would be inappropriate to just insert specious personal views into what gender and sex are.

"I generally appreciate David Pakman, but on this topic he is either dishonest or ignorant.''Altering the definitions of words is common politics. The right has tried to re-define “liberal” with the term “classical liberal”, to imply Liberals are authoritarian. The left tried to re-define “racism” to imply racism could not come from minority groups. These are political activities designed to alter our society. In fact, the core battle of two massively important political movements, feminism and LGBT+,  is over the definition and concept of the word woman. To imply a discussion on definitions is irrelevant to a political or a legal conversation is gaslighting. To imply it is bad faith is to weakly dismiss the concerns of the right. After all, the right is merely responding to the political efforts of the left to alter the society through definitions of the word woman. As the supreme court has exercised society altering powers by literally interpreting words to mean certain things, it is absurd to claim questions on definitions of words at the center of political discourse are off limits. I want to understand Pakman’s point and I want to see dialogue on this topic, but he was so dismissive to the rights concerns that there was no chance the conversation would go anywhere.","2022-03-29

"Words and their meanings are old and come from the limited observation of past groups of people.  Sometimes they are vague, and sometimes they can be extremely specific. The problem arises when societies and it´s views on categories change, as well as when, with the growth of the population, more and more different statistical events start to become more apparent, one of them being infertility/not producing eggs (the specialized cells). So now it´s no longer that a woman is someone who has eggs and can have a baby (in the case of someone with Turner´s not only are they more likely than not to be infertile, but they don´t even have that many of the secondary sexual characteristics associated to women. Many a times will have small breats, not having that much of a curvy body, etc). Plus, not always is a woman interested in having kids. But beyond that, when science becomes a thing and it also progresses and discovers new things, it also becomes a force that leads to changes in society. In this case, it is no longer valid to say that men are (exclusively) XY and women XX (although it is the main sex differentiation system for mammals. other animals from different groups work differently, some not even having sexual chromosomes). It was discovered that the man/male part only arises if a specific gene, which is present (most of the time) in the XY chromosome, the SRY gene, is there and is functioning. So now, we don´t exactly know what is a man nor a woman just by using a single or few things to back it up. Then we have genetic alterations, affecting the number of chromosomes (duplicating or deleting whole ones or stitching together broken parts of other chromosomes into a single one, resulting in having an extra...), which can also affect sexual cormosomes (XXX, XXY, XYY, X0, etc), leading to 'men who are women' and 'women who are men', and I´m not even talking about transexual and intersex/hermaphrodite people here (there´s also the hormonal and physiological aspect of it, not just the chromosomes)... So human sex has always been a messy thing, but it just wasn´t perceived like this before (although, different societies many times also had something akin to a third sex, or something else entirely...). I´d say that human (chromosomal) sex (de facto, taking into account all these things i´ve mentioned) is more like islands. There are different kinds, and some may looks just like others. It´s (to me) not a spectrum, because you can´t directly change your (human) sexual chromosomes at a will nor through other methods, but it´s also not something binary, black and white, set in stone. And if you really want to see something crazy, I recommend you search up (genetic) chimerism/chimeras and mosaicism in humans (and other animals if you feel like it)... So yeah, not easy, but something in the law is gonna have to change, and/or the definition of a word will have to.","2022-03-29

The argument of cases don't come down to dictionary definitions is a ridiculous argument given the context of the cases that are coming or will come on this issue.  If KBJ accepts the medically and psychologically backed concepts of being intersex or transgender, then it means that she may rule a certain way.

"There were good points made by both. I try to look behind the tribalism, my side vs your side stuff, and just promote what makes sense. I know that's rare. But the definition of woman obviously matters in a legal sense. There are legal protections for women. So that was an own by Knowles. Packman can be a bad faith actor as well. Why won't he give his definition of woman? He says he doesn't deal with definitions? Bullshit. He, like everyone else, uses definitions all the time. Will u define wealth disparities? I bet you would. He doesn't want to define woman because on one hand he would make the lgbtq...lmnop...crowd mad. Then on the other hand, perhaps he doesn't want to give the 'gender is only a social construct' definition because he knows that's bullshit too.  And if u want say you are this or that, that is fine.
