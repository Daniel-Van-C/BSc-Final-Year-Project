"If Destiny really wanted to change public perception towards normalizing not firing racists, he should have debated this with someone dumber than Bastiat.",2020-05-28T00:44:07Z
Destiny LARPed as a Jordon Peterson supporter in this debate,2020-05-27T23:14:09Z
"TIL learned that Destiny sympathizes with Republicans who don't want to serve gay people cakes ' sympathizes with Nazis losing their jobs done being nazi on the own time(as if there's a proper time to being a nazi). So basically Destiny wants it both ways, but only for people on the right. The left makes Destiny  nervous because slippery slope ðŸ™„",2020-05-27T23:11:47Z
Bastiat was so based I can't believe Destiny was acting so contrarian. I doubt Destiny is against social capital as he portrays here. Social capital ' freedom of speech run hand-in-hand ' to say otherwise is to be selling you an idea. 'Does anyone think that Destiny is normalizing standing up for Nazis?,2020-05-27T23:00:27Z
"Wtf Bastiat won!? ''https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlbDJcsNTNo't=31m50s"">31:50' (Steven is just practicing Bastiat's argument in that made up scenario).",2020-05-27T22:22:46Z
"Damn, I love right to free speech and the free market, yet I'm totally on board with Destiny",2020-05-27T22:11:41Z
"If we try to take the concept to both extremes and see which one is better, its easier to determine to which side you fall on right now. Let's say there's 100% of possible social consequences to being outed as a nazi, you lose your job, can't travel, can't get housing, etc. This becomes troubling because I believe people can change and they deserve at least some level of moral consideration. However, the benefit of this system is that deplatforming nazis prevents them from raising to power, which is an incredible net positive.'On the other hand, if nazis weren't shunned, and there was 0 social repercussions, this would only bolster their movement and make it more likely that they gain power. If they gain power the consequences of that are immense and would probably destroy this country (0 immigration, ethnostate, etc). Also they would censor freedom of speech enforced by the state. So the net result of allowing their speech and having absolutely 0 social consequence is devastating.''I tend to lean pretty left, so in the first scenario I would also suffer if I'm outed as communist, but I much rather live in a neoliberal hellscape with social censorship and corporatism than a country built by nazis",2020-05-27T21:58:26Z
"How dumb is my idea? USOPS: united stated online public square. Nobody gets banned, requires some crazy level of verification (SSN or something), operates like twitter but everyoneâ€™s user names are their actual names and profile pictures are a picture of them, no alt accounts, city/ state attached to profile. Nobody can cry about being silenced, but you are held accountable for your posts",2020-05-27T21:50:37Z
Rawlsians have been harrassed by Bastiat in this debate.,2020-05-27T21:30:25Z
I have absolutely no issue with your employer or landlord or etc seeing a video of you online doing something bad and then them choosing to exclude you from their services. It's more of a 'should a motivated mob calling your employer or landlord and telling them to kick you out be considered a form of harassment?' thing.,2020-05-27T21:28:33Z
Bastiat got called a neoliberal shill on this debate,2020-05-27T21:22:20Z
One of these days Destiny is gonna have to stop orbiting Bastiat.,2020-05-27T21:13:22Z
I honestly canâ€™t make up my mind on this issue,2020-05-27T21:07:03Z
