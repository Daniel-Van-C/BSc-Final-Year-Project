"TIL learned that Destiny sympathizes with Republicans who don't want to serve gay people cakes ' sympathizes with Nazis losing their jobs done being nazi on the own time(as if there's a proper time to being a nazi).

Bastiat was so based I can't believe Destiny was acting so contrarian. I doubt Destiny is against social capital as he portrays here. Social capital ' freedom of speech run hand-in-hand ' to say otherwise is to be selling you an idea. 'Does anyone think that Destiny is normalizing standing up for Nazis?,"2020-05-27

"If we try to take the concept to both extremes and see which one is better, its easier to determine to which side you fall on right now. Let's say there's 100% of possible social consequences to being outed as a nazi, you lose your job, can't travel, can't get housing, etc. This becomes troubling because I believe people can change and they deserve at least some level of moral consideration. However, the benefit of this system is that deplatforming nazis prevents them from raising to power, which is an incredible net positive.'On the other hand, if nazis weren't shunned, and there was 0 social repercussions, this would only bolster their movement and make it more likely that they gain power. If they gain power the consequences of that are immense and would probably destroy this country (0 immigration, ethnostate, etc). Also they would censor freedom of speech enforced by the state. So the net result of allowing their speech and having absolutely 0 social consequence is devastating.''I tend to lean pretty left, so in the first scenario I would also suffer if I'm outed as communist, but I much rather live in a neoliberal hellscape with social censorship and corporatism than a country built by nazis","2020-05-27

I have absolutely no issue with your employer or landlord or etc seeing a video of you online doing something bad and then them choosing to exclude you from their services.
