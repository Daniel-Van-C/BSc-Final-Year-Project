"Reviewing the top 10 on the ARIA chart for 20/04/2022. This was number 6. MUSICALLY Always been lots of these mash ups over the years. Lets be honest it is a dancefloor track. To be honest though I wonder what makes this different to any DJ working in a back room studio. Nothing really. LYRICALLY Can I use a skip...The lyrics of Sacrifice do not fit in with the other songs. Its a dance song, lyrics aren't important. VIDEO I will give the video it's due, a good throw back to another era. Would watch this again on mute just to see the animation. RATING 4.5/10 (the .5 is just for the animation)","2022-04-20

"“Cold Heart” combines elements from several John songs. Perhaps the most notable is the use of the melody from the chorus of “Rocket Man,” as well as some of the song’s lyrics. In addition, “Cold Heart” interpolates elements of three other songs: “Sacrifice,” “Where’s the Shoorah?” and “Kiss the Bride'.''So it's actually four Elton John songs combined into one, with Dua Lipa added to it all. Pretty cool.","2022-04-05

"Both original songs (Sacrifice, Rocket Man) were great but mashing them up wasn't a smart idea, at least not the way it was done. The result isn't really a harmonious blend, but the song rather falls apart in two different tunes. I know that Elton is old and obviously doesn't know when to stop and Dua Lipa is young and obviously needs the money badly, but 'Cold Heart' is one of those creations that the world would have definitely done better without.","2022-04-03

Prefiro a linda e original Sacrifice de 1989 e Rocket Man de 1972 do que esta versão e ainda por cima com uma cantora de meia tigela! Peço desculpa pela agressividade mas eu tenho 16 anos e nasci a ouvir música antiga e não há ninguém na minha família que goste desta música! Todos odeiam e com razões não muito diferentes das minhas... Infelizmente há muita gente que irá nascer a ouvir esta música ao em vez de ouvir a original Sacrifice do Elton John!

"I went to Elton’s Concert in Kansas City, MO at the Sprint Center back in 2007.  It was phenomenal, had the best seats! He had the most talented Synthesizer who was breathtaking.  Opened with “Candle in The Wind”, the sound effects of the wind reaching such a crescendo it brought chills to your core.  When he ended ' the band was starting to put down their instruments, called them to come back to the Stage, as an homage to Kansas City ' played an extra hour. He said he credited KC for making him famous.  We certainly got our monies’ worth!","2022-01-22

Inoffensive, better than the trash that pollutes the airwaves and of course it's a gloshed mix of two old Elton John songs with a drum machine just turned on and let run in the background.

"La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.'''Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.'''¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga 'porque la paga del pecado es muerte' (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio '(Hebreos 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qod03PVTLqk't=9m27s"">9:27'). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.'''Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. 'El alma que pecare, esa morirá'. (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno 'Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes' (Mateo 13:42)'''Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.'''¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?'''Aquí hay una prueba rápida:'''1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.'''¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, 'Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida' (1 Juan 3:15)'''Santiago 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qod03PVTLqk't=2m10s"">2:10' dice, 'la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios'.'''No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:'''• 'Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron'. (Isaías 64: 6)'''La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • 'Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios'. (Lucas 18:19)'''Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?''''Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro'. (Romanos 6:23)'''Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.'''Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna'. (Juan 3:16)''Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.''Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.''por eso Jesús dijo: 'De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios'. (Juan 3: 3)''Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.''☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?'''Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión' (Hebreos 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qod03PVTLqk't=3m15s"">3:15') 'Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación'. (2 Corintios 6: 2)'''• 'Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos'. (Hechos 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qod03PVTLqk't=4m12s"">4:12')'''Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: '¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?' (Marcos 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qod03PVTLqk't=8m36s"">8:36').'''Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.'''Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo.

"This is a collaboration between, Elton John, Dua Lipa ' Pnau. They used 4 of Elton's old songs, Sacrifice, Rocket Man, Kiss the Bride,” and 1976's “Where's the Shoorah.' Elton thought it would sound cool if a female voice sang the Rocket Man chorus because everybody has heard him sing it millions of times. He sure was right about that. He wasn't able to work with people in person during Covid, so he decided to do a studio project where everybody could contribute to the project from their own homes. They changed the tempo, beat, notes ' scale of the three other songs to fit with Sacrifice as the core base song for Cold Heart.","2021-11-27

I have almost all of his albums. And I've seen him live 3 times. He might sing a little gruffer these days, but everybody ages. He's still relevant. ❤️","2021-11-21

I'm a big admirer of his early music up to around 1980's The Fox. This track is just embarrassingly banal. The earlier raw almost folk originality of Rocket Man (I never liked Sacrifice anyway) has been subsumed into a heavily  processed commercial product. He doesn't need the money. I don't understand why he chose to do this.,"2021-11-18

"I remember when I listened to 'Can't feel my face' from the Weeknd. I was like 'Huh. Gives me lowkey Michael Jackson Vibes'. Groovy Bass, the Chorus Vocals in the back, only missing a Hee Hee. Blinding Lights. Big example. Retro Synth Melody as the Main Part of the Song, really catchy, uplifting, deserved it's popularity. 'In my opinion, this one right here is a Song to honor and preserving talent. We have a 90s vibe with old and new legends. 'There are some artists, that bring the 80s and 90s back, with better Synthesizers and easier ways to produce music. And I am hyped what the future may bring.","2021-11-08

"I'm not a huge Elton fan.  Of course, I love many of the classics and am able to see his talent.  However, I actually really love this collaboration.  Fun to have a hear a modern twist on a classic.  A lot of the newer music sounds the same and gets boring.  The industry really needs to go bring back styles from the 90s and earlier...when many real instruments were used and people had actual bands...before everything became computerized.  Artist had to have real talent and voices weren't manipulated.  Real talent is what made people famous...and not where if someone has what is considered a profitable look, then their voice doesn't really matter because it can be fixed.  Also, the creativity and willingness to experiment with different sounds was more common.  Seemed like things constantly evolved and were fresh.  Ill get off my soap box, and sounding like a crotchity old person...which I'm as old as my rant sounds...but kudos for a fun song!","2021-10-22

Industry balanced score card''Music performance excellent''Production good''Support artists average''video below average''Commentry''The much preferred industry choice was a duet with Karlie Manogue. This is the first significant level one investment since the mderation of the pandemic.''Video the technology of CGI is still in its infancy.Experiements for the new ABBA songs saw only a muted response to this technology until it is developed further. The industry forcast by the BSC Consulting group was the resurgence of rock in roll in the UK and disco in the us market. Its is noted that this production reenforces this trend including the platform shoes and beat tempo.,"2021-10-19

"Elton John has had nothing significant to offer, musically, for years and this regurgitated double up composition confirms that position. It is all froth and no substance, decorated with a fancy animation video and a collaboration with a younger generation singer, cleverly marketed to catch the gullible in its net. For this track to reach #1 on the “music” chart is a great example of how appalling the standard of excellence has dropped over the past decade (or more).

"Most will simply find this tune catchy.  Music junkies, DJ's, and producers know what PNAU did here and it is top notch.  One of the best remixes/edits I've heard in quite a while.  The Rocket Man hook sung by Lipa is doubled up with a filtered Elton John vocal that adds an eerie layer of sorrow that that Elton captured in the original Rocket Man.  Lipa/s modulation adds hope, and builds to the simulated church choir ending.  So strong.","2021-10-14

"I swim year round in a local lake in the PNW of Washington State...typically 1-1/2 hours, 5 days a week...last March the water got to 42 degrees. I just heard this song a week ago and immediately put it on my SwiMP3 player,  set it on repeat and now swim to it at least 2-4 times. I was a huge Elton fan when I was young (I'm 67), have his original records and, because I was also a musician, have his song books with full scores and lyrics. This song makes me so happy...I also listen to it when I'm doing housework or driving in my car. Kudos also to Dua Lipa. We need more of this in our current social drama. Play on, Sir Elton.","2021-09-24

I've been a fan of Sir Elton John for over 40 years and a fan of Dua Lipa for over 5 years and I have to say that this 'song' is a prime example of musical laziness. It's the same parts over and over again. No originality at all. I'm quite disappointed in them. They're capable of WAY better. They could have done a MUCH better collaboration without this 'PNAU' interference.,"2021-09-23

"Imagina se a nova moda é artista de outras eras fazendo remake de hits antigos com artistas novos. Elton John é um ícone e vem ajudando a nova galera do pop como dua lipa, lil nas x, miley cyrus, rina sawayama e esteve presente no ultimo álbum da lady gaga. Esse cara é um icone que jamais cairá no esquecimento, seja na era dele, seja na nova era do pop.","2021-09-13

I've been discovering his music the past weeks on spotify and it's been amazing. I hope he will be popular once more with a new generation because his music is too good. I hope he will still be around for a very long time, a living legend.🙏👏","2021-09-13

"Awesome song, before and now, and the video is so damn cute!!'My first t-shirt I ever chose and bought with a singer on it, was one with Elton John with one of his signature awesome eyeglasses, kicking ' his platform shoe in the foreground. I think the glasses were stars. I have been wearing glasses since I was 7, so at 13 years old, I wore that shirt proudly. I bought it at the beach. I wish I still had it. Circa 1975","2021-09-12

"I know it shouldnt bug me, but it does. Is no one else bothered that this song uses 25% of Rocket Man lyrics? Out of 11 lines of singing, 3 of them are Rocket Man - WORD FOR WORD. And it uses the same melody. I honest to God thought this was a remix at first. Most of Duo Lipa's lyrics 'And I think it's gonna be a long, long time, 'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home'.... are from Rocket Man.

"My thoughts on Cold Heart:''This is amazing. On the one hand, I get why people would hate this. It's just a mashup of Elton John songs with Dua singing the hook to Rocketman, Dua and Elton have no chemistry, and the move can be seen as cynical. But on the other hand, this sounds amazing. All I wanted out of this was Elton and Dua's awesomeness colliding with each other in a beautiful way, and that's exactly what I get. This is easily one of the best official mashups of an artist's work, right up there with The Click's Overture and Schmoyoho, Accent on the Yo by The Gregory Brothers. I get the hate, but Cold Heart is beautiful, and does exactly what it sets out to do. 8/10.","2021-09-06

"Esta es una de esas canciones creadas para triunfar, un hit prefabricado para romper en pistas de baile. Los artistas británicos Elton John y Dua Lipa han unido sus voces en un nuevo tema que sale al mercado con el título 'Cold Heart (PNAU Remix)', basado en cuatro clásicos de Elton hábilmente mezclados por la banda australiana de electrónica PNAU. Los temas en cuestión son: Kiss The Bride (del álbum Too Low For Zero), Rocketman (Honky Chateau), Where's the Shoorah? (Blue Moves) y Sacrifice (Healing Hands). PNAU y Elton John ya colaboraron en el pasado, cuando alcanzaron en 2012 el número uno en la lista de éxitos del Reino Unido con el álbum Good Morning to the Night.'En la nota de prensa, el compositor británico reconoce que 'los últimos 18 meses han sido duros, pero celebro que, al no estar en la carretera he tenido más tiempo para volver a mis raíces como músico de estudio y colaborar con maravillosos artistas'.'Música independiente novedades.","2021-09-02

"Been a massive house music fan for the last 45 years, and whilst I always respected Elton John’s supreme singing skills, song writing genius and piano skills, I was never a big fan of his pop ballads. ''Dua Lipa seemingly came out of nowhere in the last 5 years with a world class voice, perhaps not rivalling Amy Winehouse as the top ever voice in pop, but definitely very close. Despite loving her voice, again I was never a big fan. ''Together, though, this is just a complete masterpiece. Lyrics and riffs taken from a few of Eltons tracks, combined in to this absolute beauty!  A pop song with a house beat and legendary mixed vocals. Perhaps the mixer/producer is the one that deserves applaud, but I’m no expert, just a random idiot making a YouTube comment. ''Apologies in advance for this super self-indulgent comment that nobody cared or asked for but it is what it is. Hope at least somebody read it and wasn’t at least too bored 👍🏻","2021-08-28

"When I first saw these PNAU remixes, I rolled my eyes and thought they were cheesy.  What can I say - I'm an Elton John 'traditionalist.'  I never gave them a chance, not one single time.  When I saw Elton's Cold Heart live video from that restaurant in Cannes, I thought, 'Hmm...that's interesting.'  Now that I've listened to it a number of times, I simply love it.  I went back and listed to PNAU's other tracks with an open mind and they're really quite genius.  They stitch these songs together as if they were meant to be together.   If I ever met PNAU, I'd give them a hug.  I hate it when I judge works of art simply because I hate change.  I'm a new fan.","2021-08-27

"I don’t get this, honestly. I know that remixes and modernisations can be great, but this feels really impotent, it’s just four bar segments of Sir Elton’s amazing songs stitched together and produced with modern drums and techniques. It’s cool that this may highlight Sir Elton and his music to younger audiences, but this isn’t better than any one of those songs by a long way, doesn’t add anything to them, and doesn’t hold up as a song itself for me, really. Don’t know why Dua was needed, either. Would have preferred just this style, but just Sir Elton and a producer applying it to one or another of the songs- would have been Sacrifice for me.","2021-08-22

Mais qui remplacera Elton John quand ces étoiles meurt.. une peur de ne plus avoir la relève de ces écrivains magique d'un autre temps ils font tant de bien à nos oreilles et à nos vies la base de cette chanson était déjà magnifique est-ce que vous en avez fait et magique pour qu'elle traverse le temps''Bisous à tous!!,"2021-08-22

What a cheap song.  Elton John apparently thought we wouldn't notice that he merged his Rocketman and Sacrifice songs to make this song.  'Oh let's just throw in a guest singer and it's unlikely that anyone will notice.'  I guess he was wrong.  I wish he would create something original.  I know he can.  He's done so for over 30 years.,"2021-08-21

"I can't believe that there have been thumbs down on this song. Okay so we all remember Sir Elton John for his classics and this is totally different to what we expect from him but he is moving with the times and trying to please different audiences. Imagine how hard that is because he knows he will set himself up for criticism from some but to me he is such a humble man and self-made without a silver spoon. He hasn't had things handed to him. He's worked hard to achieve what he has. He is a legend...up the top there. Afterall, how many solo artists are still going strong at his age and now he's doing his farewell tour...we have a true British Gem in Sir Elton 😊","2021-08-18

Me encantó este remix soy fan de Elton Jhon ❤🚀 y lo amo él es maravilloso y Dua Lipa es increíble... El video es muy colorido y todo pero no me agradaron esas muñecas con cara de gato nose me dan un poco de miedo; son desagradables a la vista...😬 Además se mueven muy lento con la canción es lo único que no me gustó yo las quitaría...

Los dibujos animados de Elton y Dua Lipa son perfectos y hubiera sido un acierto si tuvieran mas protagonismo en el vídeo, con mas movimientos y bailando entre los dos cantantes.''Todo es una opinión muy personal.

"Pnau were given access to Elton's back catalogue and pored over it, collecting, moving the material (but in my opinion keeping the original cadences and emotions) to create new or remixed tracks. This track has been supplemented and enhanced by the blend of Dua Lipa's vocal using original lyrics / music from EJs back catalogue. It is highly unlikely that Elton put a note to it as the magic in Pnau's knowledge of the catalogue. So by all means hail the original genius of John / Taupin, but marvel at the skills of Pnau.","2021-08-13
