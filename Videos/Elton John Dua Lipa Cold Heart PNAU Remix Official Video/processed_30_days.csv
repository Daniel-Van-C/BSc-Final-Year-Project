"Reviewing the top 10 on the ARIA chart for 20/04/2022. This was number 6. MUSICALLY Always been lots of these mash ups over the years. Lets be honest it is a dancefloor track. To be honest though I wonder what makes this different to any DJ working in a back room studio. Nothing really. LYRICALLY Can I use a skip...The lyrics of Sacrifice do not fit in with the other songs. Its a dance song, lyrics aren't important. VIDEO I will give the video it's due, a good throw back to another era. Would watch this again on mute just to see the animation. RATING 4.5/10 (the .5 is just for the animation)","2022-04-20

"“Cold Heart” combines elements from several John songs. Perhaps the most notable is the use of the melody from the chorus of “Rocket Man,” as well as some of the song’s lyrics. In addition, “Cold Heart” interpolates elements of three other songs: “Sacrifice,” “Where’s the Shoorah?” and “Kiss the Bride'.''So it's actually four Elton John songs combined into one, with Dua Lipa added to it all. Pretty cool.","2022-04-05

"Both original songs (Sacrifice, Rocket Man) were great but mashing them up wasn't a smart idea, at least not the way it was done. The result isn't really a harmonious blend, but the song rather falls apart in two different tunes. I know that Elton is old and obviously doesn't know when to stop and Dua Lipa is young and obviously needs the money badly, but 'Cold Heart' is one of those creations that the world would have definitely done better without.","2022-04-03
