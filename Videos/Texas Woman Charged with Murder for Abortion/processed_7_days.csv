"If someone strikes a pregnant woman such that she miscarries, shouldn't the perpetrator be charged with manslaughter? If it was intentional, is it not murder? So, how is it suddenly 'not' murder when the perpetrator is the mother?","2022-04-27

"It’s amazing that the people who cried the loudest about having to wear a mask or getting a vaccine fail to recognize the cognitive dissonance of having the government telling women what they can do with their bodies? For me, it was easy to reconcile. If you didn’t want to wear a mask or get a vaccine, then you live with the informed decision when you contracted Covid and risked death for you and your families.","2022-04-24

"Pregnancy unless planned will not be an open topic. Women, young women, teenagers who do not expect to get pregnant but through some kind of interference in their lives become pregnant will keep the information quiet. Back to underground abortions. Crimes will go unreported and the guilty will be free to harm more women. This is a huge problem.","2022-04-22

I grew up in a red state and used to be anti-abortion or pro-life before I realized that the left has FAR better arguments on the abortion issue. Republicans are so extreme they won't even make exceptions for if a woman's life is endangered by her pregnancy. They've never seemed to have a problem with letting people die once they're born.,"2022-04-21

Texas does not run Texas. The Church runs Texas like it does many other states. The Church just flexes in Texas first to set the precedent and take it on the road across America.,"2022-04-21
