The problem is, I have no idea how to take this behemoth down. We know that those who identify with formal religions are shrinking in numbers rapidly especially among the youth, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be making a difference to the cult.

God is the creator, man pro creates.  Jesus said born again not conceived again, Nicodemus (a religious man of his time said how can I get back in my mother's womb) which was impossible since his mother was dead. Jesus tried to put a picture together but was  gracious given he was a religious man. So can the courts pass judgement on a religious matter? When the scriptures made a reference to knitting together in the womb its references Jesus. Question if God knit everyone in the womb how would religion explain deformities or mental retardation at birth. It cant. We all know that all people are not born equal.  Why? Human condition. Human frailties.  There's a thousand things that can effect the outcome of a human birth all human . But what is equal is the soul given.  If they charge this woman with murder the courts will be instrumental in establishing a Catholic dogma.
