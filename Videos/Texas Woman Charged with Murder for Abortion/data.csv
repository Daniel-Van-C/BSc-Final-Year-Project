"If someone strikes a pregnant woman such that she miscarries, shouldn't the perpetrator be charged with manslaughter? If it was intentional, is it not murder? So, how is it suddenly 'not' murder when the perpetrator is the mother?",2022-04-27T09:51:05Z

I grew up in a red state and used to be anti-abortion or pro-life before I realized that the left has FAR better arguments on the abortion issue.

Maybe they‚Äôll put ankle monitors on pregnant women to track their movements and cameras in the home to track her behavior.

"The whole subject is religious, how can you charge murder with no body,  biblically if you study the doctrine of the soul and go from start Adam first created, its given at first breath. God is the creator, man pro creates.  Jesus said born again not conceived again, Nicodemus (a religious man of his time said how can I get back in my mother's womb) which was impossible since his mother was dead. Jesus tried to put a picture together but was  gracious given he was a religious man. So can the courts pass judgement on a religious matter? When the scriptures made a reference to knitting together in the womb its references Jesus. Question if God knit everyone in the womb how would religion explain deformities or mental retardation at birth. It cant. We all know that all people are not born equal.  Why? Human condition. Human frailties.  There's a thousand things that can effect the outcome of a human birth all human . But what is equal is the soul given.  If they charge this woman with murder the courts will be instrumental in establishing a Catholic dogma.
